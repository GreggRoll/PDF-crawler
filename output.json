            "Foreword\nADP 1 and ADP 3-0, Operations, are the two Army capstone doctrinal manuals that serve as the foundation of\nour professional body of knowledge. It explains our Army\u2019s historical significance in the formation and\npreservation of our Nation and its role today and in the future as a member of the joint force to guarantee the\nNation\u2019s strength and independence. At the heart of this doctrine is the professional Soldier\u2013our true asymmetric\nadvantage and most valued asset.\nToday\u2019s Soldiers are the legacy of the millions of Soldiers who came before them. They each freely volunteer to\nserve a higher purpose\u2014an ideal greater than themselves. Soldiers continually demonstrate their character,\ncommitment, and competence to protect our Nation under demanding and complex conditions. The oath they\nfreely take to the Constitution of the United States is our Soldiers\u2019 sacred bond to maintain the confidence of the\nAmerican people as trusted professionals in the world\u2019s premier land force.\nThe Army\u2019s unique role as part of the joint force is to shape operational environments, prevent conflicts, conduct\nlarge-scale ground combat operations, and consolidate gains to achieve enduring national objectives. Only the\nArmy is capable of mounting sustained large-scale ground combat operations. The Total Army, comprised of the\nRegular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve, provides the Nation with a land force unequaled in\nskill, adaptability, professionalism, and power.\nIn today\u2019s volatile operational environment, our Army must remain ready to answer the Nation\u2019s call anywhere\nand anytime, with little or no notice. Because of this, readiness for large-scale ground combat is our first priority.\nWhile we continue to develop future capabilities and care for families, we take best care of our Soldiers when we\nmaintain our solemn commitment to never send Soldiers into harm\u2019s way unless they are fully trained, properly\nequipped, and most importantly, properly led. This is our moral imperative and what the American people trust\nus to do. The fundamental role of the American Soldier today is the same as it was over 244 years ago\u2014to win.\nThat is the challenge our Army must always be ready to meet, today and tomorrow.\nMMAARRKK AA..

            "Introduction\nLandpower is the ability\u2014by threat, force, or occupation\u2014to gain, sustain, and exploit control over land,\nresources, and people (ADP 3-0). Our Army provides the United States with a campaign-quality force able\nto secure, seize, and occupy terrain; sustain itself; and enable our unified action partners to interact with,\nsecure, or control populations. When necessary, the Army conducts large-scale ground combat operations on\nland to achieve strategic objectives and impose our will on enemies. No other force has this capability.\nOur Army exists to defend the Nation and protect our Nation\u2019s interests. We answer the Nation\u2019s call to serve\nwhenever and wherever required. As the preeminent land warfighting force in the world, we are capable of\nmanaging crises and conducting large-scale ground combat as part of the joint force. Our Soldiers, leaders,\nand units possess the tactical and technical competence to conduct successful operations across the full range\nof military operations and the competition continuum. We maintain the trust of the American people who\nrely on the Armed Forces to protect and defend the Constitution and to guarantee their freedom, security, and\ninterests as we have always done.\nTo talk about our Army is to talk about its rich and dynamic history. On 14 June 1775, the Second Continental\nCongress established the Continental Army, instituting the United States Army as the first Service of the\nArmed Forces of the United States. As one of the oldest American institutions, our Army predates the\nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution. For almost two and a half centuries, Soldiers have built a\nlegacy of character, competence, and commitment symbolized by the 190 campaign streamers that adorn the\nArmy flag\u2014each one signifying the great sacrifices of Soldiers on behalf of the Nation and the American\npeople.\nThe Army today is a force that is prepared to defend the Nation and protect our national interests through\nprompt and sustained land combat. This includes forcible entry from the land, sea, or air; closing with and\ndestroying a determined enemy with fires and movement; sustaining the Army and joint forces; consolidating\nbattlefield gains to facilitate a sustainable peace; and defending our homeland. The Army organizes, trains,\nand equips the force to conduct offensive, defensive, and stability operations when employed abroad and\ndefense support of civil authorities (DSCA) tasks at home. (See figure introduction-1 on page vi.)\nThe Army accomplishes its mission by supporting the joint force in four strategic roles: shaping operational\nenvironments, preventing conflict, prevailing in large-scale ground combat operations, and consolidating\ngains. The Army helps the joint force win when it achieves its operational objective in the performance of its\nroles across the range of military operations. The strategic roles clarify the enduring reasons for which our\nArmy is organized, trained, and equipped. The Army provides its core competencies to the joint force, which\nare essential and enduring capabilities that enable unified action. These competencies define the Army\u2019s\nfundamental contributions to the Nation\u2019s defense.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 v",
            "Introduction\nFigure introduction-1. Prepared to defend\nTechnological change, as well as both state and non-state actors that threaten global stability, continuously\ninfluence the Army. Our Army is a foundational component of the joint force that defeats enemies who\nchallenge U.S. interests worldwide. Army forces provide combatant commanders the means to shape\noperational environments, deter potential adversaries, defeat enemies in all land environments, and\nconsolidate military gains on the ground to ensure sustainable outcomes.\nThe Soldiers of today are the legacy of a proud heritage of selfless and courageous Americans who fought at\nLexington and Concord, held the line at Yorktown, charged up Missionary Ridge, and went over the top in\nthe Argonne Forest. We are descended from those who held fast in the Ardennes, conducted amphibious\nassaults across the Pacific, and perfected air-mobility in Southeast Asia. Many Soldiers still serving brought\npeace and stability to the Balkans, while thousands more are in harm\u2019s way in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other\ndangerous places. The guiding foundations logic chart shows how the Army continues this legacy of service.\n(See figure introduction-2.)\nSoldiers with physical and moral courage, the ability to think critically and creatively, and the resilience to\nendure hardship provide the Army its collective strength. Soldiers are the strength of our Army today and\ntomorrow, just as they have been since 1775.\nvi ADP 1 31 July 2019",

            "Chapter 1\nWhy America Needs an Army\n[Y]ou don\u2019t dictate end states from the air. You can\u2019t control territory. You can\u2019t influence\npeople. You can\u2019t maintain lines of control after you\u2019ve established them. That will take a\nground force\u2026.\nGeneral Mark A. Welsh III, Air Force Chief of Staff\nThe Nation\u2019s need for a capable, ready Army is enduring even if it has not always been\na priority. During important moments in our Nation\u2019s history, such as the beginning of\nWorld War II and the Korean War, ill-prepared Army forces sacrificed at great cost to\nbuy time while the Nation went through the deliberate and time-consuming process of\nproperly organizing, equipping, and training sufficient ground forces. The first battles\nended badly. U.S. Army forces in the Philippines and Korea suffered painful defeats in\nlarge part because they were not prepared for war. While Soldiers fought valiantly in\nboth places, they were not ready for combat. Given the lessons of our own history, and\nthat large-scale ground combat against a peer threat is no longer unthinkable, it is our\nmoral imperative to ensure that we send no Soldiers into combat unless they are\nproperly equipped, trained, and led.\nARMY RESPONSIBILITIES\n1-1. The primary responsibility of our Army is to conduct prompt and sustained land combat as part of the\njoint force. The Army must deliver ready, trained, and equipped forces to meet the demands placed upon it.\nOur Nation expects the Army to be lethal, agile, and adaptive. In 1899, Secretary of War Elihu Root wrote,\n\u201c[T]he real object of having an army is to prepare for war.\u201d When not engaged in direct conflict, the Army\nfocuses its efforts on conducting operations to prepare for and deter war. Our Army achieves readiness\nthrough sound doctrine, capable organizations, realistic training and education, modernized equipment,\ninspired leadership, and disciplined Soldiers. Readiness is what makes our Army credible.\n1-2. Our Army is interdependent with the other elements of the joint\nforce and serves as the foundation upon which the joint force conducts Joint interdependence is the\npurposeful reliance by one\nland operations. Just as the Army requires joint capabilities to conduct\nService on another Service\u2019s\noperations, the joint force also requires Army capabilities to succeed\ncapabilities to maximize the\nacross the multiple domains of air, land, maritime, space, and\ncomplementary and\ncyberspace. Army support to other Services provides key enabling\nreinforcing effects of both.\ncapabilities to the joint force to include operational-level command and\ncontrol, communications, intelligence, and sustainment support. Only credible and ready land forces\noperating as an element of the joint force provide U.S. decision makers with strategic options to shape\noperational environments, prevent conflict, prevail during large-scale ground combat operations, and\nconsolidate gains to win in volatile or uncertain environments.\n1-3. Landpower enables the Nation\u2019s leaders to respond to security challenges in definitive and decisive\nways. Landpower focuses on destroying an enemy\u2019s armed forces, occupying its territory, and breaking its\nwill. Landpower protects our national interests, brings order to chaos, and protects populations. Only the\nArmy has the capability and capacity to seize, occupy, and control large land areas; provide civil security;\nand provide a visible and physical presence throughout a territory or country. Controlling land requires a\ncommitment of landpower, a commitment historically met by Army forces and expressed by U.S. Navy Rear\nAdmiral J. C. Wylie:\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 1-1",
            "Chapter 1\nThe ultimate determinant in war is a man on the scene with a gun. This man is the final\npower in war. He is in control. He determines who wins. There are those who would dispute\nthis as an absolute but it is my belief that while other means may critically influence war\ntoday, after whatever devastation and destruction may be inflicted on an enemy, if the\nstrategist is forced to strive for final and ultimate control, he must establish, or must\npresent as an inevitable prospect, a man on the scene with a gun. This is the Soldier.\n1-4. The Army\u2019s legacy of service makes clear the critical role of the American Soldier before, during, and\nafter conflict. War will continue to remain an intensely human endeavor. To defend our Nation\u2019s security\nand prosperity in the increasingly interconnected and volatile world, the Army must remain globally engaged,\nprovide America\u2019s leaders with options, and defend the Nation\u2019s vital interests on the ground. This requires\na well-trained and equipped Army prepared to protect the homeland, to defeat any enemy worldwide, and to\nprovide disaster relief or humanitarian assistance when called upon. (See figure 1-1.)\nFigure 1-1. The Army\u2019s legacy of service\n1-5. The Army\u2019s essential characteristics of trust, honorable service, military expertise, stewardship, and\n\u00e9sprit de corps enable the Army to serve America faithfully as an established military profession. These\ncharacteristics of the Army Profession reflect our national ideals, the Army Values, the Army Ethic, and the\nArmy\u2019s approach to accomplishing its mission to defend the Constitution and the American people. Soldiers\nand Department of the Army (DA) Civilians are professionals, guided in everything they do by the Army\nEthic. They are certified and bonded with other Army professionals through a shared identity and service\nwithin a culture of trust.\n1-2 ADP 1 31 July 2019",
            "Why America Needs an Army\n1-6. Today\u2019s Soldier joins those men and women who previously served the Nation with courage and\ndedication. The campaigns and battles for which our forbearers fought set clear milestones marking the\nArmy\u2019s role and importance in American history. The Army\u2019s historical legacy discussed in the appendix\nhelps illuminate the challenges our Army faced in the past and will likely face in the future.\nTHE TOTAL ARMY\n1-7. The Department of Defense directs the Army to organize, train, and equip as an integrated total force.\nIt consists of three components: the Regular Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve.\nTogether, the three components representing the Total Army ensure that we have the capacity, capability,\nand endurance to do what the Nation requires. (See figure 1-2.)\nFigure 1-2. The Total Army\nREGULAR ARMY\n1-8. The Regular Army, commonly referred to as the active duty force, consists of full-time Soldiers\nsupported by the Army Civilian Corps. The Regular Army is under the command of the President of the\nUnited States. Service-specific matters are the responsibility of the Secretary of the Army, the Chief of Staff\nof the Army, and other appointed officials. The Regular Army includes units of all specialties necessary for\nthe prompt employment of land forces. However, the Regular Army relies upon units and capabilities\nmaintained in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve.\nARMY NATIONAL GUARD\n1-9. The Army National Guard has a dual role based on the Constitution. Its first role is that of a state\nmilitary force. Its second role is as an operational reserve for the Regular Army. Each state, the U.S. territories\n(Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands), and the District of Columbia have Army National Guard units\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 1-3",
            "Chapter 1\ntotaling 54 state and territorial National Guards. Army National Guard forces remain under the command of\ntheir respective governors until mobilized for federal service. Each state or territory Army National Guard\nhas an adjutant general\u2014a general officer appointed by the governor\u2014who serves as its uniformed leader.\nThe governor can order the Army National Guard to state service since it is a state military force. The Army\nNational Guard responds to natural disasters and other domestic emergencies many times each year. While\nserving their states, these Soldiers are subject to civil laws and their states\u2019 Codes of Military Justice. A\ngovernor can use the Army National Guard of the state for law enforcement, which is something that federal\nmilitary forces cannot perform except under special circumstances. A small number of Army National Guard\nSoldiers are on full-time active duty, a duty status called \u201cActive Guard and Reserve.\u201d\n1-10. When ordered to active duty, Army National Guard Soldiers become subject to the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice and fall under the command of combatant commanders. Army National Guard forces are\nsimilarly organized and equipped as units in the Regular Army and Army Reserve. The Department of the\nArmy provides their equipment, provides much of their funding, and is responsible for assessing their combat\nreadiness. However, states retain latitude in recruiting, manning, and training. (See figure 1-3.)\nFigure 1-3. Training\nARMY RESERVE\n1-11. The Army Reserve is under the command of the President and serves as a federal military force.\nElements of it mobilize when required. Most Army Reserve Soldiers serve for a period in the Regular Army\nand then elect to continue their service in the Reserve. The Army Reserve makes up about a fifth of the\nArmy\u2019s organized units, but it provides a half of the Army\u2019s sustainment units, a fourth of the Army\u2019s\nmobilization base-expansion capability, and most of its civil affairs capacity. The Army Reserve is also the\nArmy\u2019s major source of trained individual Soldiers for strengthening headquarters and filling vacancies in\nthe Regular Army during a crisis. Many Army Reserve Soldiers are also civilian professionals, such as nurses,\ndentists, and computer technicians, who augment critical Army specialties. Similar to Army National Guard\nmembers, a small number of Army Reservists are full-time active duty.\nARMY CIVILIAN CORPS\n1-12. The Army has the largest civilian workforce in the Department of Defense. DA Civilians are full-time\nand enduring members of the profession. The Army Civilian Corps provides the complementary and\nreinforcing skills, expertise, and competence required to project, program, support, and sustain the uniformed\nside of the Army.\n1-13. DA Civilians have assumed increased levels of responsibility and greater authority since the Army\ntransitioned to a professional volunteer force. Over 23,000 DA Civilians have deployed to Afghanistan and\nIraq in support of the uniformed Services since 2001. They hold senior leadership and mission critical\npositions in operating forces and key positions in the institutional force. DA Civilians also serve in Army\nReserve centers. Like Soldiers and members of Congress, they take an oath solemnly swearing that they will\n1-4 ADP 1 31 July 2019",
            "Why America Needs an Army\nsupport and defend the Constitution. Like their uniformed counterparts, DA Civilians live the Army Values\nand prepare for unforeseen future threats.\nTHE ARMY FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE\nYou may fly over a land forever; you may bomb it, atomize it, pulverize it and wipe it clean\nof life-but if you desire to defend it, protect it, and keep it for civilization, you must do this\non the ground, the way the Roman legions did, by putting your young men in the mud.\nT. R. Fehrenbach\n1-14. Soldiers and DA Civilians serve in two functionally discrete entities known as operating forces and the\ninstitutional force.\nOPERATING FORCES\n1-15. Operating forces consist of units organized, trained, and equipped to deploy and fight. They make up\nabout two-thirds of the Regular Army and three-fourths of the Army\u2019s total force. The Secretary of Defense\nassigns these units to the various combatant commanders. Operating forces are modular. They consist of\ninterchangeable units grouped under various headquarters. When a joint force commander specifies the\ncapabilities needed, the Army provides tailored force packages to provide those capabilities. In addition to\nconventional forces, the Army also provides the largest element of the joint special operations forces. Army\nspecial operations forces include several special forces groups, the Ranger Regiment, civil affairs units,\nmilitary information support units, and special operations aviation.\nTHE INSTITUTIONAL FORCE\n1-16. The institutional force ensures the readiness of all Army forces. The institutional force consists of\nArmy organizations whose primary mission is to generate, prepare, and sustain operating forces of the Army.\nTherefore, the institutional force remains under the command of the Department of the Army. The training\nbase provides military skills and a professional education to every Soldier\u2014as well as to members of the\nother Services and multinational partners. The institutional force is also the Army\u2019s principal interface with\nthe commercial sector. Our national industrial base provides equipment and sustainment for the Army\nmanaged by the various headquarters of the institutional force. Army installations are power projection\nplatforms that train forces and serve as departure points. Once operating forces deploy, the institutional force\nprovides the sustainment that Soldiers need for their missions and specified support provided by the Army to\nthe other Services. The institutional force focuses on departmental (Title 10, USC) tasks including\u2014\n(cid:122) Recruiting.\n(cid:122) Maintaining.\n(cid:122) Organizing.\n(cid:122) Servicing.\n(cid:122) Supplying.\n(cid:122) Training.\n(cid:122) Educating.\n(cid:122) Mobilizing.\n(cid:122) Demobilizing.\n(cid:122) Administering (including the morale and welfare of personnel).\n(cid:122) Developing, outfitting, and repairing military equipment.\n(cid:122) Equipping (including research and development).\n(cid:122) Constructing, maintaining, and repairing facilities.\n1-17.

            "Chapter 2\nToday\u2019s Army\nTo be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.\nGeorge Washington\nThe Army operates in all domains, converging its capabilities to control land, which is\nthe most complex domain of all. This is where conflicts are most often resolved and\nsustainable outcomes achieved. The land domain includes humanity in its entirety of\ncultures, religions, social and economic groups, and politics. These can all be drivers\nof instability and conflict in today\u2019s operational environments. The Army enables and\ninfluences operations across the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains, each of\nwhich has influence on the land domain. Winning on land requires Soldiers, leaders,\nand units to have the skills, knowledge, and attributes to operate effectively in\nambiguity and chaos. Continuous learning, adaptation, and agility are the keys to\nwinning in lethal and uncertain environments.\nOPERATING IN THE LAND DOMAIN\n2-1. The variations in climate, terrain, velocity and complexity of human interaction, and the diversity of\npopulations have a far greater impact on operations in the land domain than in any other domain. The most\ndistinguishing characteristic of the land domain is the human element. Humans temporarily transit the air,\nmaritime, and space domains, but they ultimately live on land. Controlling terrain, infrastructure, and\npopulations are uniquely human-oriented endeavors that require Soldiers to operate in the midst of political,\neconomic, social, and religious tumult. The human context informs how the Army conducts operations among\npopulations, within the military, political, and physical constraints of the environment. Winning battles and\nengagements alone is insufficient for achieving sustainable outcomes. Army forces consolidate gains with\nand among populations to ensure battlefield victories translate into long-term success.\n2-2. Geographic combatant commanders implement various security cooperation activities to shape the\nenvironment in ways favorable to U.S. interests. Most activities involve working with foreign security forces\non the ground. These activities build partner defense capabilities and enhance the overall security of the\ntheater. Our assistance assures our multinational partners and improves joint force access to key regions. The\ndegree of security cooperation communicates U.S. commitment, strength, and awareness to adversaries in\nthose regions. If necessary, combat-ready Army units deploy to threatened areas to reinforce host-nation\nforces, complement joint air and maritime forces, and communicate clear U.S. intent to resist aggression.\nPartnership develops trust, improves interoperability, and builds shared understanding as our Soldiers\npositively influence host-nation forces, leaders, populations, and other government agencies. This partnership\nproduces enduring positive effects for regional stability and effective deterrence.\n2-3. Few nations can afford to field and employ a large air force or navy. The principal military forces\nacross the globe are armies, even in regions often defined by their proximity to large bodies of water. For\nmost nations, defense and security considerations center on land forces. The United States furthers many of\nits strategic interests using Soldiers who work on a daily basis directly with multinational partners to improve\ntheir ground forces. Our Soldiers make the Army the most capable land force in the world, which in turn\nmaintains U.S. credibility and security.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 2-1",

Due to the size and number of its combined arms formations, the Army is the only U.S. force capable\nof defeating threats around the globe during sustained land combat. The Army is uniquely organized, trained,\nand equipped with the depth and capabilities to be a credible land force deterrent against world and regional\npowers. Should deterrence fail, the Army, with its unified action partners, makes victory against an enemy\ndecisive. (See figure 2-1.)\nFigure 2-1. The Army as part of the joint force\nOPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS\n2-6. Variables within an operational environment pose numerous challenges. The context in which these\nchallenges present themselves adds layers of complexity to military endeavors. Advances in information\nsystems, robotics, directed energy, propulsion, biological engineering, and other fields are changing the world\n2-2 ADP 1 31 July 2019",
            "Today\u2019s Army\nat a rapid pace. The Army, as part of the joint force, must contend with these changes as the swift pace of\nhuman interaction and events continues to increase. This environment requires Army units that are trained,\nequipped, and led to operate across the competition continuum in situations that may include enemies with\nsuperior conventional capabilities, weapons of mass destruction, and advanced cyberspace and counter-space\ncapabilities. Our units must operate competently in any terrain and in close coordination with unified action\npartners.\n2-7. To meet global challenges, the joint force conducts operations quickly and in sufficient scale to shape\nan environment, prevent conflict through deterrence, prevail in combat, and consolidate gains to achieve\nenduring security outcomes. The Army\u2019s role in pursuit of these objectives is unique and tied closely to the\nhuman dimension.\n2-8. Enemies and adversaries are often not easy to identify or locate. State and non-state actors operate\nagainst the U.S. openly and covertly. These actors are often armed with the most advanced weapons while\nalso using simple low-cost technologies to mitigate U.S. capabilities, exploit vulnerabilities, threaten vital\ninterests, and promote local or regional instability. The Army operates in and among populations to counter\nthreats that originate on land but can endanger U.S. interests across multiple domains.\nUNIFIED ACTION\n2-9. The Army operates with other Services in a joint comprehensive approach called unified action.\nUnified action is the synchronization, coordination, and/or integration of the activities of governmental and\nnongovernmental entities with military operations to achieve unity of effort (JP 1). Unified action partners\nare those military forces, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and elements of the private\nsector with whom Army forces plan, coordinate, synchronize, and integrate during the conduct of operations\n(ADP 3-0). These operations ensure unity of effort and create multiple dilemmas for an enemy force allowing\nfriendly forces to seize and exploit the initiative. The synergy that results from joint force operations\nmaximizes the capabilities of U.S. military power.\n2-10. The complexity and lethality of operations in the land domain demand mastery of combined arms\noperations, which includes the full array of joint capabilities. Combined arms operations are the synchronized\napplication of two or more elements of one Service along with other unified action partners and their\ncapabilities. These operations are an extension of the historical idea of combined arms\u2014the synchronized\napplication of arms to achieve an effect greater than if each arm was used separately. Combined arms is not\na new idea. The Army\u2019s history contains multiple examples of how well executed combined arms operations\nled to success on the battlefield. Mastery of combined arms operations remains necessary for success in the\n21st century. It can only be achieved through demanding and repetitive training.\n2-11. The Army depends on and supports air and naval forces across all domains. The Army depends on the\nother Services for strategic lift, joint fires, joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and other\ncapabilities. The Army supports other Services, combatant commands, multinational forces, and other unified\naction partners with communications, intelligence, rotary-wing aviation, air and missile defense, logistics,\ncommand and control, and engineering. Collectively, the Army calls these capabilities \u201cArmy support to\nother Services.\u201d These relationships create joint interdependence or an integration of complementary and\nreinforcing capabilities at strategic, operational, and tactical levels of warfare.\n2-12. The effects of joint interdependence provide extraordinary support to tactical units. The vast array of\njoint capabilities enable the employment of small units in decentralized fashion across vast areas. Tactical\nunits can employ precise joint fires with lethal and nonlethal capabilities in minutes, delivered by systems\npotentially hundreds of miles away.\n2-13. In addition to traditional air and maritime threats, the Army and joint forces face growing threats in\nthe space domain. Ensured access to the space domain increases combined arms effectiveness and integrates\njoint capabilities. The Army maneuvers over large distances with small units enabled by communications\nthat depend on U.S. space assets. Space systems allow the Army access to communications, positioning,\nnavigation, and timing to deploy and employ rapidly and lethally. Our adversaries understand the importance\nof space capabilities and continuously develop means to contest them. Army forces must be prepared to\ncontinue operations effectively when space capabilities are degraded.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 2-3",
            "Chapter 2\n2-14. Threats from cyberspace are continuous and increasing exponentially. Our adversaries and enemies\nheavily invest in capabilities that can disrupt or deny communications support to U.S. forces while protecting\ntheir own systems. Our adversaries routinely collaborate in cyberspace by conducting coordinated tactical\noperations and strategic-level information warfare that threaten U.S. interests. These threats require Army\nforces that are ready to operate with degraded communications, reduced situational awareness, and within a\nnegative information environment. Army forces conduct cyberspace operations as part of unified action\nthroughout the range of military operations.\nJOINT MISSIONS\n2-15. The Army gives the combatant commander depth and versatility. Because land forces can conduct a\nbroad range of operations on a large scale, Army forces offer the combatant commander multiple options to\nachieve national military objectives. These capabilities include combinations of armored, mechanized,\nmotorized, airborne, and air assault formations; attack as well as lift and reconnaissance aviation; special\noperations forces; and long-duration sustainment. With their ability to combine diverse capabilities for\nspecific mission requirements, Army forces provide the combatant commander with tailorable and scalable\nforce packages to address a broad range of possible contingencies. This simultaneous use of a broad range of\nfriendly capabilities from across the Army, the joint force, and unified action partners creates dilemmas and\nnarrows options for both adversaries and enemies.\n2-16. The Army provides significant contributions to the accomplishment of the joint force prioritized\nmissions established in the National Military Strategy. Joint campaigns may require land operations as part\nof unified action since land forces often control areas or assets that influence and enable operations in the\nother domains. For this reason, land forces are vital during almost all operations, even in places where\nmaritime or air forces dominate. Joint missions are consistent with the Army\u2019s purpose and long-standing\nrole in national defense.\n2-17. Most wars and conflicts are won by committing land forces. Land forces not only seize, occupy, and\ndefend land areas, but they often also remain on the ground to consolidate gains until the achievement of\nU.S. national long-term objectives. Victory rarely stems from a single, rapid strike; swift campaigns are a\nrare exception to the historical norm. Due to the varying nature of war, conflicts often last months or years.\nWars tend to evolve into something quite different from what was originally planned as both sides adapt to\nimpose their will on one another. Land forces prove the most tangible and durable measure of America\u2019s\ncommitment to defend its interests precisely because of the effort and potential costs of doing so. The\nintroduction of land forces signals the Nation\u2019s willingness to protect multinational partners and deter\naggression.\nSTRATEGIC-LEVEL CONTEXT FOR THE ARMY\n2-18. Readiness for ground combat is and will remain the U.S. Army\u2019s first priority. The Army accomplishes\nits mission by supporting the joint force in four strategic roles: shaping operational environments, preventing\nconflict, prevailing in large-scale ground combat, and consolidating gains. The strategic roles clarify the\nenduring reasons for which our Army is organized, trained, and equipped. Army forces are further organized,\ntrained, and equipped to provide specific core competencies delivering essential and enduring capabilities\naligned with joint doctrine. The Army\u2019s operational concept of unified land operations described in ADP 3-0\nis built on the conceptual framework established by the Army\u2019s strategic roles and its core competencies.\nTitle 10, USC, the National Military Strategy, and DODD 5100.01 provide the overall guidance on the\ncapabilities that the Army must provide to the Nation. The Army shapes operational environments and\nprevents conflict based upon the requirements of combatant commanders. The ability to prevail against any\nenemy during large-scale ground combat is what provides the military credibility necessary to deter war.\nEvery operation must consolidate gains to make temporary operational success enduring and set the\nconditions for a sustainable and stable environment. Our non-negotiable obligation to the Nation is to win by\nachieving the combatant commander\u2019s operational objective when the Army is committed to any type of\noperation.\n2-4 ADP 1 31 July 2019",
            "Today\u2019s Army\nSHAPE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS\n2-19. The Army provides unique forces with capabilities to shape operational environments. Shaping\noperational environments allows combatant commanders to reassure partners and deter aggression while\nestablishing conditions that support the potential employment of joint forces. Army regionally aligned\nforces\u2014including special operations units, Army Reserve units, and Army National Guard units\u2014assist\npartners with internal defense and develop the capabilities needed to deter adversaries and defeat enemies.\n(See figure 2-2.) Army forces further develop relationships with multinational partner land forces, share\nintelligence, strengthen their security forces, increase cultural awareness, and conduct bilateral and\nmultilateral military exercises. Through efforts such as the State Partnership Program, Army National Guard\nand Reserve units supply unique and dual-trained Soldiers with special skills obtained as civilians to assist\nin medical and engineering activities, disaster preparedness, critical infrastructure management, and resource\nprotection. Together, these efforts allow the Army to maintain a global landpower network that is critical in\nshaping operational environments and winning wars. Army forces conduct shaping operations through the\nday-to-day actions of its Service component commanders, trainers, advisors, and logistic activities as\nspecified under Title 10, USC and support to Title 22 and Title 50, USC.\nFigure 2-2. Soldiers with special skills\nPREVENT CONFLICT\n2-20. Preventing conflict includes all activities that deter adversary military actions which threaten allies or\npartners and deny them the ability to achieve objectives counter to U.S. interests. A well-trained, credible,\nand capable Army reduces the risk of aggression by adversaries because it raises both the risk and potential\ncost of military action to their forces. Moving ready and trained Army forces into a region tells adversaries\nthat the United States is prepared and willing to protect its interests. Partner nations under external threats\nunderstand that introducing U.S. forces alters the regional military balance of power in their favor and\nbolsters their resolve to resist aggression. Multinational partners and adversaries recognize that Army\nforces\u2014combined with the nation\u2019s joint air, maritime, and space-based forces\u2014are dominant and therefore\nare a deterrence to armed conflict. This role meets the objectives described in the National Military Strategy.\nPREVAIL IN LARGE-SCALE GROUND COMBAT\n2-21. The Army\u2019s capability and capacity to conduct large-scale ground combat is unique and foundational\nto its other roles. Only the Army has the capabilities necessary for sustained ground combat anywhere in the\nworld. The credibility inherent in its ability to conduct large-scale ground combat as part of the joint force is\na critical part of U.S. conventional deterrence. It is a primary source of assurance to friendly nations and an\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 2-5",

When it deploys and fights, the Army both enables and is enabled by the other Services when\nthey perform their roles. An Army that can defeat any enemy worldwide requires professionally committed\nleadership, well-equipped and trained units, and proficiency in the conduct of joint and multinational\noperations. Maintaining the readiness necessary for large-scale ground combat is a difficult and continual\nprocess that consumes significant time and resources. Readiness for large-scale ground combat operations\nsaves lives.\nCONSOLIDATE GAINS\n2-22. Operations to consolidate gains make temporary operational successes enduring and set the conditions\nto facilitate the transition of control over territory to legitimate authorities. Army forces enable the joint force\ncommander to capitalize on operational success by following through to ensure sustainable conditions on the\nground. Consolidation of gains is an integral part of winning armed conflict and is essential to retaining the\nlong-term initiative over determined adversaries. Army forces reinforce and integrate the efforts of all unified\naction partners when they consolidate gains. Operations serve a higher national purpose in support of U.S.\ninterests and are planned and executed to support that purpose at each echelon. A clear understanding of the\nhigher purpose of the mission and operational environment determines what must happen to consolidate gains\nduring the course of operations. How well ground forces consolidate gains determines in large part how\nenduring the results of operations will be. Effectively consolidating gains increases options for national\nleaders and contributes to decisive outcomes. (See figure 2-3.)\nFigure 2-3. An enduring Army\nWIN\n2-23. Winning is the achievement of the purpose of an operation and the fulfillment of its objectives. The\nArmy wins when it successfully performs its roles as part of the joint force during operations. It wins when\nit effectively shapes an operational environment for combatant commanders and when it responds rapidly\nwith enough combat power to prevent war through deterrence. When required to fight, the Army\u2019s ability to\nprevail in large-scale ground combat becomes a decisive factor in breaking an enemy\u2019s will to continue\nfighting. Army forces win when the enemy is defeated to the degree that it can no longer achieve their\nobjectives or effectively contest the joint force on land. To ensure that the military results of combat are not\ntemporary, the Army follows through with its unique capability to consolidate gains and ensure enduring\noutcomes that are favorable to U.S. interests.\n2-6 ADP 1 31 July 2019",

Sustained land\ncombat spans the range of military operations. It requires a force that can sustain its efforts for as long as\nnecessary and can adapt to unpredictable changes in an operational environment.\nCOMBINED ARMS OPERATIONS\n2-26. All operations are combined arms operations. Combined arms is the synchronized and simultaneous\napplication of arms to achieve an effect greater than if each element was used separately or sequentially\n(ADP 3-0). Combined arms includes Army capabilities and joint, multinational, and other unified action\npartner capabilities. Combined arms operations integrate leadership, information, and each of the warfighting\nfunctions. Used destructively, combined arms integrate different capabilities so that responding to one\ncapability makes the enemy vulnerable to another. Combined arms multiply the effects of Army and joint\ncapabilities in operations. They require highly trained Soldiers, skilled leaders, and integrated information\nsystems. Commanders synchronize combined arms capabilities using command and control to employ\ncombat power to their best advantage.\n2-27. Combined arms maneuver is the application of combat power in time and space to defeat enemy\nground forces; seize, occupy, and defend terrain; and achieve physical, temporal, and psychological\nadvantages over the enemy. Combined arms maneuver seizes, retains, and exploits the initiative. Army forces\napply combat power from unexpected directions, achieve surprise, and render an enemy force unable to\nrespond effectively.\n2-28. Wide area security is the application of the elements of combat power to protect populations, unified\naction partners, infrastructure, and activities to deny enemy forces positions of advantage across large\nexpanses, to consolidate gains, and to retain the initiative. Wide area security includes six stability tasks in\nsupport of a host nation: establish civil security, establish civil control, restore essential services, support\ngovernance, support economic and infrastructure development, and conduct security cooperation.\n2-29. Armored and mechanized operations provide the capability to conduct sustained and large-scale\nground combat operations. The Army has the unique capability to employ large formations of armored,\nmechanized, and motorized forces that provide protected ground mobility and firepower. These forces can\nbe an asymmetric advantage when used against an enemy force without comparable capability, and they may\nbe used to defeat an enemy\u2019s anti-access and area-denial measures when employed from offset objectives.\nArmored, mechanized, and motorized forces are an essential part of the joint force as a maneuver force in\nclose combat. Armored and mechanized forces serve as a deterrent to armed conflict and can deploy\nworldwide.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 2-7",
            "Chapter 2\n2-30. The Army uses airborne and air assault operations, as part of the joint force, to project large military\nforces rapidly into an operational area, sustain those forces in the face of armed opposition, and, if necessary,\ndefeat enemy anti-access and area-denial capabilities. Projecting and sustaining airborne and air assault\nforces requires the capability to secure multiple entry points into an operational area. The joint force\napplication of airborne and air assault operations for forcible entry gives leaders flexibility and depth to set\nconditions. Airborne and air assault operations capitalize on mobility to surprise an enemy force, seize a\nlodgment, and gain the initiative. Airborne operations are unique from other operations in that they can\nproject and deliver operationally significant forces over strategic distances.\nSPECIAL OPERATIONS\n2-31. Special operations require unique modes of employment, tactics, equipment, and training. Army\nspecial operations forces provide combatant commanders with precise lethal and nonlethal capabilities. These\ncapabilities include special warfare and surgical strike operations in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive\nareas. These operations may be time sensitive, clandestine, low visibility, and high risk. Special operations\nforces possess uniquely assessed, organized, trained, and equipped Soldiers. The interdependence of special\noperations and conventional forces, gained by the right mix of complementary and reinforcing capabilities,\nenhances success throughout the range of military operations across the competition continuum.

The Army\u2019s ability to set and sustain the theater is essential to allowing the joint force to seize the\ninitiative while restricting an enemy force\u2019s options. Setting the theater for the joint force includes the\nestablishment of access and infrastructure to support joint force operations. The Army possesses unique\ncapabilities to establish and maintain vital infrastructure and support the joint force commander. These\ncapabilities include intelligence support; communications; port and airfield opening; logistics; ground-based\nair defense; chemical defense; and reception, staging, onward movement, and integration. Sustaining the\ntheater for the joint force includes theater sustainment and meeting executive agent responsibilities.\nMaintaining critical infrastructure\u2014as well as sustaining joint forces, unified action partners, and\nmultinational forces\u2014is accomplished through the Army\u2019s support to other Services, executive agent, and\nTitle 10, USC, requirements.

Army headquarters and forces help impose order to chaotic situations and synchronize plans,\nprograms, and efforts necessary to accomplish the mission.\nUNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS\n2-34. Army forces accomplish their missions through the operational concept called unified land operations.\nUnified land operations is the simultaneous execution of offense, defense, stability, and defense support of\ncivil authorities across multiple domains to shape operational environments, prevent conflict, prevail in large-\nscale ground combat, and consolidate gains as part of unified action (ADP 3-0). Army forces defeat enemy\nforces, control terrain, protect populations, and preserve joint force freedom of action in the land domain by\napplying the Army core competencies. Army operations conducted overseas encompass offensive, defensive,\nand stability operations. Within the United States, the Army supports civil authorities through DSCA. If\nenemy forces threaten the homeland, Army forces combine offense and defense with DSCA. The effort\naccorded to each element is proportional to the mission and varies with the situation and conditions of an\noperational environment. (See figure 2-5.)\nFigure 2-5. Unified land operations\n2-35. During operations, Army forces enable joint force freedom of action by denying enemy forces the\nability to operate uncontested in domains other than land wherever possible.

Even when conducting dispersed operations, mobile combined arms teams exercising\nmission command can concentrate combat power rapidly to isolate enemy forces, attack critical enemy assets,\nand exploit opportunities.\nMISSION COMMAND\n2-36. Mission command is an approach that empowers subordinates and is necessary for success in complex\nand ambiguous environments. Two hundred years ago, commanders could generally see the entire battlefield\non which they fought as well as the friendly and enemy forces on that ground. This meant that commanders\ncould personally observe situations, make decisions, and closely control their forces during battle.\n2-37. By the time of the Civil War, the growth of armies in size and complexity extended forces beyond the\ndirect view of one person. Commanders could no longer personally control all the forces under their\ncommand. As a result, American commanders began to practice an approach that favored decentralized\nexecution. This approach meant using mission orders that emphasized the purpose of an operation to achieve\na desired end state rather than the accomplishment of individual tasks. Subordinate leaders at all echelons\nwere required to exercise initiative within the commander\u2019s intent to accomplish missions.\n2-38. The 1905 Field Service Regulation first codified these ideas. It contained the following passage that\nserved as an early explanation of the mission command approach:\nAn order should not trespass on the province of the subordinate. It should contain\neverything, which is beyond the independent authority of the subordinate, but nothing\nmore. When the transmission of orders involves a considerable period of time during which\nthe situation may change, detailed instructions are to be avoided. The same rule holds\nwhen orders may have to be carried out under circumstances, which the originator of the\norder cannot completely forecast, in such cases, letters of guidance are more appropriate.\nIt should lay stress upon the object to be attained, and leave open the means to be\nemployed.\n2-39. Subsequent versions of our Army\u2019s operations manual have built on this idea. Mission command is the\nArmy\u2019s approach to command and control. Over time, changes within operational environments required the\nArmy to decentralize operations to the maximum extent possible. Mission command allows for the\nempowerment of subordinates to exercise disciplined initiative and implement decisions based on their\nunderstanding of the commander\u2019s intent rather than a directed order or task.\n2-40. Mission command requires leaders at the lowest practical echelon to seize, retain, and exploit the\ninitiative by directing action under varying degrees of uncertainty. Commanders seek to counter the\nuncertainty of an environment by empowering subordinates at the lowest level to make decisions, act, and\nquickly adapt to changing circumstances. These situations may lead a subordinate to deviate from the initial\ndirective as long as it is within the desired commander\u2019s intent. Mission command is based on mutual trust\nand a shared understanding of purpose among commanders, subordinates, and unified action partners.\nIn1941 Admiral E. J. King stressed the importance of training leaders and units in mission command:\nIf subordinates are deprived\u2014as they now are\u2014of that training and experience which will\nenable them to act \u201con their own\u201d\u2014if they do not know, by constant practice, how to\nexercise \u201cinitiative of the subordinates\u201d\u2014if they are reluctant (afraid) to act because they\nare accustomed to detailed orders and instructions\u2014if they are not habituated to think, to\njudge, to decide and to act for themselves in their several echelons of command\u2014we shall\nbe in sorry case when the time of \u201cactive operations\u201d arrives.\n2-41. Mission command requires a command climate in which commanders encourage subordinates to\naccept risk and exercise disciplined initiative to seize opportunities and to counter threats, all within the\ncommander\u2019s intent. Commanders realize that subordinates will make errors. Successful commanders allow\nsubordinates to learn through their mistakes and develop experience. With an accepting command climate,\nsubordinates gain the experience required to operate on their own. Using mission orders, commanders focus\non the purpose of the operation rather than on the details of how to perform assigned tasks. This focus\nminimizes centralized control and allows subordinates the greatest freedom of action. When delegating\nauthority to subordinates, commanders set the necessary conditions for success by allocating appropriate\n2-10 ADP 1 31 July 2019",

Effective operations are possible when commanders have the expertise and communications to\nsynchronize Army, joint, and multinational combat power and to integrate the effects of unified action\npartners. Commanders, supported by their staffs, use the operations process to drive the conceptual and\ndetailed planning necessary to understand, visualize, and describe their operational environments; make and\narticulate decisions; and direct, lead, and assess military operations. The operations process of plan, prepare,\nexecute, and assess enables Army forces to integrate joint, multinational, and other unified action partner\ncapabilities throughout operations.\n2-43. Commanders cannot exercise command and control alone. The science of control\u2014regulating,\nmonitoring, and directing unit actions\u2014requires sophisticated and rugged information systems along with a\nwell-trained staff to employ appropriate processes. Even knowledgeable and charismatic commanders cannot\ncontrol everything beyond their immediate surroundings without the supporting personnel, networks,\ninformation systems, processes and procedures, and facilities and equipment. These components, as well as\nspace and cyber capabilities, help commanders understand situations to make and implement better decisions.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 2-11",

The U.S. Army is the most lethal and capable ground combat force in history. It has proven this in\nmultiple conflicts, across a broad spectrum of operations, in various locations around the world, defending\nthe Nation and serving the American people well for over 240 years. The key to this success has been the\nskill and grit of the American Soldier, the quality of its leaders, the superiority of its equipment, and the\nability of the Army\u2014Regular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve\u2014to adapt to and dominate a\ncomplex and continuously changing environment as a member of the joint force.\n3-2. As we look ahead, competitors such as China and Russia will increasingly challenge the United States\nand our allies in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, we should expect\nthese countries\u2019 arms, equipment, and tactics to be used against us by others, including threats such as North\nKorea and Iran, failed states, and terrorist groups. Our adversaries\u2019 ambitions and the accelerating pace of\ntechnological change will create challenges and opportunities for the Army\u2019s battlefield superiority.\n3-3. Meanwhile, the many demands on our Nation\u2019s resources will put downward pressure on the defense\nbudget in the future, forcing the Army to continue making difficult choices about how it spends valuable\ndollars to meet national military objectives and compelling us to become ever more efficient. A continued\ncommitment to strengthening our alliances and building partnerships will help offset these challenges.\nARMY MISSION\n3-4. The Army mission\u2014our purpose\u2014remains constant: to deploy, fight, and win our Nation\u2019s wars by\nproviding ready, prompt, and sustained land dominance by Army forces across the full spectrum of conflict\nas part of the joint force.

Given the threats and challenges ahead, it is imperative the Army has a clear and coherent vision of\nwhere it wants to be in the coming years so that Army forces retain overmatch against all potential adversaries\nand remain capable of accomplishing our mission in the future. As such, the Army Vision, our future end\nstate, states\u2014\nThe Army of 2028 will be ready to deploy, fight, and win decisively against any adversary,\nanytime and anywhere, in a joint, multi-domain, high-intensity conflict, while\nsimultaneously deterring others and maintaining its ability to conduct irregular warfare.\nThe Army will do this through the employment of modern manned and unmanned ground\ncombat vehicles, aircraft, sustainment systems, and weapons, coupled with robust\ncombined arms formations and tactics based on a modern warfighting doctrine and\ncentered on exceptional Leaders and Soldiers of unmatched lethality.\n3-6. To achieve our vision, the Army must meet five objectives in the coming years:\n(cid:122) Man\n(cid:122) Organize.\n(cid:122) Train.\n(cid:122) Equip.\n(cid:122) Lead.\n3-7. The first objective is to man.This involves growing the Regular Army above 500,000 Soldiers, with\nassociated growth in the National Guard and Army Reserve. The Army will meet this objective by recruiting\nand retaining high quality, physically fit, mentally tough Soldiers who can deploy, fight, and win decisively\non any future battlefield. (See figure 3-1.)\n3-8. Organize is the second objective that ensures warfighting formations have sufficient infantry, armor,\nengineer, artillery, and air defense assets. Units from brigade through corps must also have the ability to\nconduct sustained ground and air intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; electronic warfare; and\ncyberspace operations to shape the battlefield across all domains. Aviation, additional combat support, and\nrobust logistic support must be readily available to units.\n3-9. The third objective is train.Effective training focuses on high-intensity conflict, with an emphasis on\noperating in dense urban terrain, in electronically degraded environments, and under constant surveillance.\nTraining must be tough, realistic, iterative, and dynamic. Continuous movement, battlefield innovation, and\ncombined arms maneuver with the joint force, allies, and partners must be its hallmarks. This training requires\nrapid expansion of our synthetic training environments and distributing simulations capabilities further down\nto the company level to significantly enhance Soldier and team lethality.\n3-10. Equip is the fourth objective. Equipping the Army means modernizing the force. First, the Army\nreforms the current acquisition system. Second, the Army unifies the modernization enterprise under a single\ncommand to focus the Army\u2019s efforts on delivering the weapons, combat vehicles, sustainment systems, and\nequipment that Soldiers need when they need it. This modernization includes experimenting with and\ndeveloping autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and robotics to make Soldiers more effective and\nunits less logistically dependent.\n3-11. The last objective is lead.The Army will develop smart, thoughtful, and innovative leaders of character\nwho are comfortable with complexity and capable of operating from the tactical to the strategic level. We\nwill build a new talent management-based personnel system that leverages the knowledge, skills, behaviors,\nand preferences of its officers and noncommissioned officers. This system, when coupled with more flexible\ncareer models, will enable the Army to better attract, identify, develop, and place these leaders to optimize\noutcomes for all.\n3-2 ADP 1 31 July 2019",

They identify lower value activities to discontinue and note ways to\nimprove what we must do to free up time, money, and manpower for our top priorities. Trusting and\nempowering subordinate leaders facilitates both reform and greater performance.\n3-13. In all these efforts, we will ensure that our Soldiers, DA Civilians, and their Families enjoy the\nprofessional opportunities and quality of life they deserve.

Since George Washington transformed an ill-equipped Army into a professional force at Valley Forge,\nAmerican Soldiers have served the Nation by responding to national emergencies, defending its frontiers,\nprotecting its growth, providing humanitarian assistance, enabling the joint force, working with multinational\npartners, and, most importantly, winning its wars. (See figure A-1 on page A-2.) No other profession demands\nthe profound level of personal sacrifices required of our Soldiers and their Families. For American Soldiers,\nthe most meaningful line of the Declaration of Independence is the sentence that closes the document: \u201cfor\nthe support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually\npledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\u201d\nA-2.

Following the initial engagements in Massachusetts, the Second Continental Congress established the\nAmerican Continental Army on 14 June 1775. Eight more years of war followed.\nA-6. At the close of the Battle of Saratoga, an American commander took the surrender of a British field\narmy for the first time. The roots of the victory at Saratoga lay in the militias organized in the American\ncolonies to provide for their common defense. The Continental Congress, using the militia concept as a\nfoundation, officially ratified provisions to establish the Continental Army in June 1775 making it America\u2019s\noldest military Service. Between 1776 and 1780, the Continental Army and militias worked together as a\ntotal force to defend the American interior and develop new tactics. American forces lost a number of major\nengagements in this period, but they were able to maintain their presence in the field through their unwavering\ncommitment to prevent the British forces from controlling key areas. In 1781, the mature Continental Army,\ncommanded by General George Washington and supported by French allies, seized the initiative and\nmaneuvered to a position of advantage that resulted in the ultimate defeat and surrender of the British at\nYorktown.

At the outbreak of conflict with the British, the U.S. Army was small, spread along the frontiers in\nsmall garrisons, and forced to expand quickly. Amateur officers leading poorly trained Soldiers struggled in\nthe field against the British for much of the war. Eventually leaders such as Lieutenant Colonel Winfield\nScott trained Army units capable of standing up to the British in combat on the Northern Frontier.\nA-8. Andrew Jackson used regulars and militia at New Orleans to crush the largest British army sent to\nNorth America. A combination of Regular Army, local militia, and volunteer formations successfully\ndefended New Orleans from British regiments recently arrived from fighting on Napoleonic battlefields in\nEurope. The American victory at the Battle of New Orleans, coupled with naval successes, helped secure the\nindependence of the young Nation and its expansion to the West. The lessons learned from this conflict\nsolidified the need for a standing professional force with sufficient capability and capacity to meet the\nNation\u2019s needs.

The Army gradually grew as it defended the national coastline and protected citizens moving into the\nfrontier. The Army actively assisted Americans as they expanded westward by providing explorers to map\nnew territories and engineers to build roads, dig canals, and improve navigation on waterways. The Army\nCorps of Engineers facilitated navigation along the inland waterways, allowing inexpensive travel and\nmovement of goods using the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries.

About an hour later, after Pickett\u2019s\ncharge had failed to break the Union line, close to 7,000 Americans in blue and gray uniforms lay dead or\nwounded on the ground. The battle, a Union victory, was the last time the Confederate forces seriously\nthreatened the North. The war, which raged on for another two years, had divided the U.S. Army and the\nNation.

Ill prepared and at low levels of readiness, the first Army forces deployed to South Korea gave up\nground as North Korean forces seized much of South Korea. Fighting valiantly in the Pusan Perimeter while\nsupported by other Services, Army forces improvised a defense that prevented North Koreans from seizing\nthe entire Korean Peninsula.\nA-28.As part of a larger United Nations force, U.S. Army forces counterattacked, forcing the North Koreans\nback into their territory by October 1950. Intervention by the Communist Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army\nthat month pushed United Nations forces back into South Korea. What was a fluid campaign of maneuver\nbecame a stalemate characterized by tough combat in unforgiving conditions. When a ceasefire ended the\nhostilities in 1953, the Korean Peninsula remained divided. American Soldiers have remained in South Korea\never since to deter further aggression from North Korea. America\u2019s continued presence in South Korea\ncontributed to the emergence of South Korea as a democratic and powerful military and economic ally in\nAsia. During the Korean War, the Army earned 10 campaign streamers listed in table A-12.\nTable A-12.

            "Appendix A\nVIETNAM CONFLICT\nA-29.A decade after the armistice in Korea, Army forces fought another Cold War campaign in Asia.\nAmerican involvement in South Vietnam had increased since the late 1950s in response to escalating pressure\nfrom Communist North Vietnam. Operations in Vietnam saw many innovations to combined arms operations\nincluding the emergence of air mobility and air-ground operations, special operations and conventional force\ninterdependence, and decentralized counterinsurgency operations. These operations also highlighted the\nchallenges of a conscript force reliant on individual replacement to sustain the campaign.\nA-30.The U.S. military presence in South Vietnam gradually grew to over half a million Soldiers. They\u2014\nalong with South Vietnamese soldiers, seven other multinational forces, and government agencies\u2014\nconducted counterinsurgency operations against Viet Cong guerillas and mounted conventional combat\noperations against North Vietnamese regulars. Success in these efforts led U.S. commanders to believe that\nthey and the South Vietnamese forces had made progress toward the final defeat of the threat. In January\n1968, however, enemy forces launched the Tet Offensive across South Vietnam. U.S. Soldiers and their South\nVietnamese partners ultimately defeated this large-scale attack, destroying the Viet Cong as an effective\ncombat force. Over the next three years, the United States slowly turned over the fight to the South\nVietnamese in preparation for the withdrawal of all military forces. By 1973, the United States had withdrawn\nall Army forces from Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, the Army earned the 17 campaign streamers listed\nin table A-13.\nTable A-13.

In 1965, the Army, with support from elements of the Organization of American States, occupied\nthe Dominican Republic to prevent a communist takeover of the country.\nA-32.After the Vietnam War, Army leaders turned to rebuilding and reinvigorating the force. Most\nimportantly, the Army became a smaller all-volunteer force made up of professional Soldiers highly trained\nand equipped with the most modern weapons. Armed Forces expeditions conducted during this period\nincluded combat operations in Grenada in 1983 and the forcible removal of the dictator Manuel Noriega in\nPanama in 1989. These operations highlighted the need for the Army to continue to improve joint operations.\nDuring these Armed Forces expeditions, the Army earned the 4 campaign streamers listed in table A-14.\nTable A-14.

            "Our Army\u2019s Legacy of Service\nSOUTHWEST ASIA\nA-33.A crisis in 1990 erupted following the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein\u2019s seizure of Kuwait. Army forces\nmobilized and deployed 500,000 Soldiers equipped with advanced equipment as part of an international\ncoalition that crushed Hussein\u2019s forces in one of the most lopsided wars in history. OPERATION DESERT\nSTORM cemented the interdependence of the components within the Army to the joint force. As part of the\nTotal Army, the Army National Guard and Army Reserve provided unique capabilities essential to the\nsuccess of the coalition forces. During actions in southwest Asia, the Army earned the 3 campaign streamers\nlisted in table A-15.\nTable A-15. Southwest Asia Service streamers\n(cid:120) Southwest Asia Cease Fire (cid:120) Defense of Saudi Arabia (cid:120) Liberation and Defense of Kuwait\nBOSNIA AND KOSOVO\nA-34.Beginning in December 1995, Army forces participated in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led\neffort to end ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, formerly part of Yugoslavia. Army units enforced the Dayton\nAccords as part of the Implementation Force (known as IFOR) in 1995\u20131996 and then as part of the\nStabilization Force (known as SFOR) from 1997 until 2004, ending the violence and restoring order. The\nArmy\u2019s ability to project credible force and disciplined professionalism established the conditions for an\nenduring political solution.\nA-35.In 1999, ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia led to the commitment of Army forces in a peace\nenforcement operation in the province of Kosovo. During operations in Kosovo, the Army earned the 2\ncampaign streamers shown in table A-16.\nTable A-16. Kosovo Campaign streamers\n(cid:120) Kosovo Air Campaign (cid:120) Kosovo Defense Campaign\nWAR ON TERRORISM\nA-36.In the aftermath of the attacks of September 11 in 2001, Army forces deployed to Afghanistan and\neventually Iraq. American-led forces drove Saddam Hussein and the Taliban from power in fast moving\ncampaigns noted for the relatively small numbers of troops and the sophistication of joint operations.\nAmerican forces, alongside multinational forces, continue to conduct counterterrorism and stability\noperations in both Afghanistan and Iraq to deny terrorist safe havens while promoting regional stability.\nA-37.The 14 campaign streamers currently associated with the War on Terrorism are listed in table A-17 on\npage A-10.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1 A-9",

            "Introduction\nDoctrine is dynamic and changing. It is based on lessons learned in current operations and training, from\nadaptive enemies, and after changes in force structure, technology, and social values. This publication\nprovides the basic information necessary to understand Army doctrine and the ways it changes. It clarifies\nwhy various constructs exist and how they all fit together. It is a guide for professionals about the language\nof the profession.\nStarting with Baron von Steuben\u2019s Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United\nStates, doctrine in various forms has guided the Army through peacetime and war. Lessons learned from\nworld wars and other operations shaped and codified how Army forces operated. (Army forces refers to Army\norganizations whose role is to conduct operations in the field. The Army refers to the Army as an institution.)\nIn the early 1900s, Army doctrine consisted of fewer than 40 field service regulations and drill manuals.\nGradually, doctrine grew to over 500 field manuals. Although they provided tactics and procedures, these\npublications lacked a clear hierarchy that served to both categorize and prioritize information. Leaders\nsometimes struggled to determine what was truly important for all professionals and what was important only\nto a branch or functional area. Additionally, as doctrine evolved, it saw a prolific growth of terms and\nexpressions used. This growth sometimes obscured the relationship of terms and expressions such that\nSoldiers and their leaders did not clearly understand them.\nThe Army transition required a re-examination of Army doctrine. This transition moved the Army\u2019s focus\nmore on readiness for large-scale combat against peer threats since 2015 and the 2018 National Defense\nStrategy, which had been heavily influenced by operations of the past 20 years. The 2017 version of FM 3-0\nsubsequently drove revisions to doctrine across all warfighting functions to ensure doctrinal publications\nadequately addressed both large-scale ground combat operations and those elements of the multi-domain\noperations future concept that could be implemented with the Army\u2019s currently fielded capabilities. As part\nof the effort, the Army decided to combine Army doctrine publications (known as ADPs) with their\nassociated Army doctrine reference publications (known as ADRPs) to reduce redundancy. The Army\ncontinues to revise field manuals (known as FMs) and Army techniques publications (known as ATPs), as\nappropriate. These revisions make publications relevant to near-term operational environments and ensure\nArmy doctrine is balanced to support Army forces conducting operations across the competition continuum\nand the range of military operations.\nLeaders and Soldiers must understand what Army doctrine is, what its purpose is, how it is organized, and\nwhy its information is important. The precursor to this understanding is a definitive text on the why of Army\ndoctrine\u2014a doctrine primer. The doctrine primer becomes the standard for evaluating future doctrine; it\nallows the Army to discipline the establishment of terms and the categorization of operational knowledge.\nChapter 1 first looks at what doctrine is and why it is important. Chapter 2 examines the doctrine landscape\u2014\nthe structure of doctrine, types of doctrine, the relationship of doctrine to concepts and lessons learned, and\nreasons for doctrine changes. Chapter 3 looks at the foundations of doctrine. Chapter 4 examines the terms\nand taxonomies of current doctrine. Finally, chapter 5 examines how the taxonomies work together to\nfacilitate the conduct of operations. The introductory figure on page vi illustrates the logic associated with\ndoctrine. The introductory table addresses modified terms.\nIntroductory table. Modified terms\nTerm Reason\nArmy doctrine Modifies the definition.\nfunction Army definition no longer used.

            "Chapter 1\nDoctrine and Its Role\nThe central idea of an army is known as its doctrine, which to be sound must be based on\nthe principles of war, and which to be effective must be elastic enough to admit of mutation\nin accordance with change in circumstances. In its ultimate relationship to the human\nunderstanding this central idea or doctrine is nothing else than common sense\u2014that is,\naction adapted to circumstances.\nJ. F. C. Fuller\nThe Foundations of the Science of War\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND DOCTRINE\n1-1. Every profession develops a unique body of knowledge. For the Army Profession, this body of\nprofessional knowledge is doctrine. United States (U.S.) Army doctrine is about the conduct of operations\nby Army forces in the field (and to a limited extent the guidelines for training for operations). Doctrine is the\nbody of professional knowledge that guides how Soldiers perform tasks related to the Army\u2019s role: the\nemployment of landpower in a distinctly American context. Doctrine establishes the language of the\nprofession. Just as physicians must remain proficient and current regarding the body of medical knowledge,\nArmy professionals must remain proficient and current in doctrine. The lives of the men and women who\nmake up the Army\u2014not to mention the security of the Nation\u2014rely on all leaders and Soldiers to be\nproficient in the Army\u2019s body of professional knowledge: doctrine.\n1-2. Doctrine fits into a larger body of Army knowledge. Each organization develops specific ways to do\nthings\u2014policies about the conduct of its tasks. Large, complex organizations often require more than one\nbody of knowledge to address the variety of tasks they perform. The Army is such an organization. Some\npolicies are prescriptive and include penalties for failure to follow a procedure while others are simply\naccepted, descriptive ways to do things. Some organizations call these operating procedures, rulebooks, or\nsome other term for organizational guidelines. For the Army, this larger body of knowledge includes, but is\nnot limited, to the following:\n\uf06c Army regulations and pamphlets, which address the administration of the Army.\n\uf06c Doctrine, which addresses the conduct of operations.\n\uf06c Training publications, which address specific training tasks and procedures.\n\uf06c Technical manuals, which address specific equipment-related topics.\nGo to the Army Publishing Directorate Website (https://armypubs.army.mil/) and click on the Publications\nlink to access to this body of knowledge.\n1-3. The Army approaches solutions to problems through changes to broad categories of doctrine,\norganization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF). Doctrine is\nusually the first approach taken as it is often the easiest and quickest to change and can dramatically impact\nthe conduct of operations. In some cases, the impact of changes in the other factors cannot be fully realized\nwithout a significant change in doctrine. Doctrine can also serve as the basis for changes in the other\nDOTMLPF categories.\nMEANING AND SOURCES OF DOCTRINE\n1-4. The word doctrine, from Latin doctrina, generally means the body of teachings presented to a group\nfor acceptance. For hundreds of years, people have used the word doctrine to refer to religious scripture and\nsupporting documents, as well as any set of guidelines used in various professions.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 1-1",
            "Chapter 1\n1-5. Many casual characterizations of doctrine exist (\u201cthe opinion of the senior officer present\u201d or \u201cwhat\n51 percent of the force does\u201d). The joint doctrine community defines joint doctrine as fundamental principles\nthat guide the employment of United States military forces in coordinated action toward a common objective\nand may include terms, tactics, techniques, and procedures (CJCSI 5120.02D). For the Army we define Army\ndoctrine as fundamental principles, with supporting tactics, techniques, procedures, and terms and\nsymbols, used for the conduct of operations and as a guide for actions of operating forces, and elements\nof the institutional force that directly support operations in support of national objectives. It is\nauthoritative but requires judgment in application. Army doctrine is the approved (by the Secretary of the\nArmy through the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army) body of knowledge that is taught\nand used for the conduct of operations.\n1-6. Doctrine is not established arbitrarily, nor is it static. The first source of doctrine comes from decades\nand often centuries of experience. Local procedures, best practices, and lessons learned from operations and\ntraining often gain widespread acceptance because of their applicability over time in varying circumstances.\nThe Army incorporates the best of these ideas into doctrine. This organizational learning allows doctrine to\nprovide a time-tested, coherent body of knowledge that remains relevant and easily understood. This\nknowledge provides the force with a philosophical framework for thinking about and conducting operations\nas well as specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). While grounded in enduring principles, doctrine\nis also flexible, adaptable, and changing.\n1-7. Another source of doctrine is concepts. Concepts are ideas for a significant change based on proposed\nnew approaches to the conduct of operations or technology. They become part of the Army\u2019s institutional\nprocesses for incorporating change into operations. (See paragraph 4-19 and chapter 5.) These ideas propose\nsignificantly different methods the force might use in the future, usually 5 to 15 years hence. The Army\nevaluates concepts through a series of tests. Over time, the Army discards some concepts and keeps others.\nThose concepts deemed to meet operational needs become validated concepts. The Army incorporates\nvalidated concepts into DOTMLPF solutions, often in doctrine. Leaders and Soldiers should avoid confusing\nconcepts with doctrine. Concepts are proposals and the basis for experiments on conducting future operations\nwhereas doctrine addresses how Army forces actually operate today.\n1-8. Army professionals use doctrine in two contexts: study and reflection as well as conducting (planning\npreparing, executing, and assessing) operations. Thus, doctrine is\u2014and must be\u2014both theoretical and\npractical. Doctrine is not a catalogue of answers to specific problems. Rather, it is a collection of\nfundamentals, TTP for thinking about military problems, which operations are the most complex, and what\nactions best solve them. Doctrine is not what to think or how to solve specific problems.\nTHE ROLE OF DOCTRINE\n1-9. Doctrine serves as a starting point for thinking about and conducting operations. When leaders and\nSoldiers allow it to fulfill this role, doctrine makes six basic contributions to the conduct of operations and\nthe development of military professionals. Each is vitally and equally important. Each contributes directly to\nthe conduct of operations and mission effectiveness. Doctrine\u2019s contributions\u2014\n\uf06c Provide a coherent vision of warfare.\n\uf06c Enhance operational effectiveness.\n\uf06c Provide a common frame of reference and cultural perspective.\n\uf06c Provide a common professional language.\n\uf06c Discuss Army contributions to unified action.\n\uf06c State and foster desirable traits in leaders and Soldiers.\n1-10. First, doctrine provides a coherent vision of warfare (see chapter 3). It accounts for an army\u2019s\nunderstanding of war and reflects its vision of warfare. War is socially sanctioned violence to achieve a\npolitical purpose. Warfare is the mechanism, method, or modality of armed conflict against an enemy\nWarfare is how combatants wage war. All armies have an understanding of war that underlies their visions\nof warfare. (See JP 1 for a discussion on war and warfare.) These visions directly impact the doctrine these\narmies develop to conduct operations. Armies that understand war as mechanistic and predictable tend to\ndevelop doctrine that attempts to control events to a much greater degree than armies that understand war as\na chaotic event beyond precise control. If an army\u2019s vision of warfare includes responsibilities to a civilian\n1-2 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Doctrine and Its Role\npopulation in the area of operations, then those responsibilities affect its conduct of operations. The vision of\nwarfare that underlies an army\u2019s doctrine profoundly impacts almost all facets of how that army conducts\noperations. Strong and effective leaders must understand that vision to make sense of the rest of doctrine.\n1-11. Doctrine is based on an accurate understanding of the nature of war. This vision and understanding\nenables leaders to cope with the stress and uncertainty brought about by the fog and friction of operations.\nDoctrine provides leaders and Soldiers with sound practices to account for that friction and assists them in\nmaking decisions. By providing time-tested approaches to the conduct of operations, doctrine expands\ncommander\u2019s and staff\u2019s experiences beyond what they have personally experienced to what professional\ncommanders and staffs have encountered and found to be useful for coping with complexity. Sound doctrine\nhelps them sort the important from the inconsequential and the routine from the exceptional.\n1-12. The second contribution, doctrine enhances the operational effectiveness, recognizes that Army forces\ncapture best practices and lessons learned validated from past operations, current operations, and training.\nDoctrine incorporates or adds best practices and validated lessons learned to doctrinal TTP. Best practices\nand lessons learned are disseminated along with enduring principles and TTP identified from historical\nanalysis. (See the Center for Army Lessons Learned website for details.) The resulting doctrine captures what\nhas proven useful in the past and provides a set of tools that leaders think will still be valid during current\nand near future projected operations. Much of doctrine has stood the test of time and results from extensive\noperational experience by not only Army forces, but also other Services and multinational partners. While\ndoctrine must be applied with judgment, and doctrine cannot account for every circumstance, it is always a\ngood place to start. Creatively applying different combinations of these doctrinal tools\u2014adapted to the\nspecific circumstances\u2014is the true art of tactics and foundation of operational success. For leaders and\nSoldiers unfamiliar with doctrine, every operation is experiential learning at the basic level. With a vast array\nof experiences available through studying doctrine, leaders and Soldiers make every operation more than\nbasic learning.\n1-13. Third, doctrine provides the force with a common frame of reference and a common cultural\nperspective for solving military problems. By providing a common and standardized set of principles, tactics,\ntechniques, procedures, and terms and symbols for the Army, doctrine enables flexibility, supports rapid\naction and reaction to emerging opportunities and threats, and facilitates swift adaptation during changing\ncircumstances. Commanders and staffs focus their creative efforts on solving the unique problems of assigned\nmissions without having to publish detailed procedures for completing common tasks for every mission. For\nexample, if Soldiers understand that a change in the main effort means that all or most priorities\u2014such as\nfire support, sustainment support, and so on\u2014also change, then a commander does not have to specify every\ndetail. The commander can assume that subordinate staffs and commanders will act based on a common\napproach to operations. A common approach enables units to self-synchronize both within the unit and\nbetween units. Perhaps the most important example of this common cultural perspective is the mission\ncommand approach. If leaders and Soldiers understand and exercise mission command to conduct operations,\nthen commanders can expect subordinates to exercise initiative, and subordinates can expect mission orders,\nnot detailed instructions. As a result, commanders count on more rapid decision making and more flexible\nadaptation to circumstances than if doctrine requires approval for every change in orders.\n1-14. Doctrine\u2019s fourth contribution provides a common language that allows units to pass a great deal of\ninformation quickly and succinctly. If each Soldier understands the specified tasks associated with a zone\nreconnaissance, then a commander can assign this as a task and not have to specify everything that it entails.\nIf each Soldier knows what to coordinate at a passage of lines, then the order does not have to specify every\ndetail when sending an officer or noncommissioned officer out to coordinate a passage. If every Soldier\nunderstands that assignment of an area of operations grants certain flexibility within that area of operations\nto a command and assigns certain responsibilities to the commander for actions in that area of operations,\nthen assigning boundaries does not require details of what can or cannot be done within the area of operations.\nThis common language should result in clearer, shorter orders, much greater precision in operations, and\ngreater flexibility and speed of operations.\n1-15. Fifth, doctrine discusses Army contributions to unified action. Doctrine provides a systematic body of\nthought describing how Army forces intend to operate as a member of the joint, multinational, or interagency\nforce. This in turn provides a common body of knowledge for education, training, and coordination with\nunified action partners.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 1-3",
            "Chapter 1\n1-16. The last doctrine contribution is doctrine states and fosters desirable character traits in leaders and\nSoldiers. Effective doctrine demands initiative, creativity, adaptability, and ethical action. While doctrine\nshould be broad enough and in enough depth to cover various situations, it should also provide the flexibility\nto deal with unforeseen and evolving situations.\n1-17. While doctrine does not address the workings of the institutional force (which Army regulations and\nother policy govern) except for those organizations directly supporting the conduct of operations, doctrine\ndoes play a role in several Army institutional activities. For example, doctrine provides much of the\nfoundation for professional military education, a tool for assessing organizational designs and a benchmark\nagainst which to evaluate concepts. The desirable traits that doctrine fosters (see paragraph 1-16) also apply\nto the institutional force (both Soldiers and civilians), as does the Army Ethic, as laid out in doctrine.\n1-4 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Chapter 2\nDoctrine in Context\nI am tempted to declare dogmatically that whatever doctrine the Armed Forces are working\non now, they have got it wrong. I am also tempted to declare that it does not matter that\nthey have got it wrong. What matters is their capacity to get it right quickly when the\nmoment arrives.\nMichael Howard\n\u201cMilitary Science in the Age of Peace\u201d\nTHE STRUCTURE OF DOCTRINE\n2-1. To understand doctrine, it is necessary to understand the structure of doctrine. Three taxonomies make\nup the body of knowledge called doctrine:\n\uf06c Elements of information.\n\uf06c Types of doctrine.\n\uf06c Types of Army doctrine and their hierarchy.\nELEMENTS OF INFORMATION\n2-2. Five basic elements of information are included in Army doctrine:\n\uf06c Principles.\n\uf06c Tactics.\n\uf06c Techniques.\n\uf06c Procedures.\n\uf06c Terms and symbols.\nPRINCIPLES\n2-3. A principle is a comprehensive and fundamental rule or an assumption of central importance\nthat guides how an organization approaches and thinks about the conduct of operations. In doctrine,\nprinciples can apply to the conduct of operations in general or apply to specific organizations or functions.\n(See discussion beginning in paragraph 4-4.) An example of a principle that applies to operations is the\nPrinciple of War Objective: Direct every military operation towards a clearly defined, decisive, and\nachievable goal.\nTACTICS\n2-4. Tactics is the employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to each other\n(CJCSM 5120.01A). They include the ordered arrangement and maneuver of units in relation to each other,\nthe terrain, and the enemy in order to translate potential combat power into decisive results. Tactics vary with\nterrain and other circumstances; they change frequently as the enemy reacts and friendly forces explore new\napproaches. Applying tactics usually entails acting under time constraints with incomplete information.\nTactics always require judgment in application and often require creative thinking; they are always\ndescriptive, not prescriptive. Employing a tactic may require using and integrating several techniques and\nprocedures. An example of a tactic is a movement to contact organized with a security force\u2014either a\ncovering force or an advance guard\u2014and a main body.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 2-1",
            "Chapter 2\nTECHNIQUES\n2-5. Techniques are non-prescriptive ways or methods used to perform missions, functions, or tasks\n(CJCSM 5120.01A). Techniques are more specific than tactics and less structured than procedures.\nTechniques are similar to tactics in that they are descriptive. They are similar to procedures in that they are\noften described in terms of steps. As with tactics, techniques require judgment in application. Leaders and\nSoldiers choose specific techniques based on the situation and the precise mission or task. They expect the\nconditions they encounter to affect the way they perform a given technique. An example of a technique is a\nbounding overwatch.\nPROCEDURES\n2-6. Procedures are standard, detailed steps that prescribe how to perform specific tasks\n(CJCSM 5120.01A). They also include formats for orders, reports, and control measures. Procedures are\nprescriptive. They consist of a series of steps in a set order that Soldiers complete the same way, at all times,\nregardless of circumstances or a series of formats that Soldiers must use without variation. An example of a\nprocedure is a 9-line medical evacuation (known as MEDEVAC) message.\nTERMS AND SYMBOLS\n2-7. Terms and symbols are the language and graphics used on operations. Terms are words defined in\ndoctrinal publications specifically for Army use and codified in ADP 1-02 and the DOD Dictionary of\nMilitary and Associated Terms. Symbols are those graphics defined specifically for military use. They are\ncodified in MIL-STD-2525D. Symbols specific to large-scale ground combat operations are contained in\nADP 1-02. Terms and symbols provide a common language used to communicate during the conduct of\noperations. Establishing and using terms and symbols with a common military meaning enhances\ncommunication among military professionals in all environments and makes a common understanding of\ndoctrine possible. Terms and symbols are prescriptive. They must be used as defined in ADP 1-02.\nDESCRIPTIVE VERSUS PRESCRIPTIVE\n2-8. Doctrine clearly distinguishes between descriptive and prescriptive information. Most doctrine is\ndescriptive; it must be applied with judgment. It is not dogma to be applied blindly. It must be adjusted to\nthe circumstances of an operational environment. Techniques and procedures have a clear distinction.\nWhereas techniques are non-prescriptive ways to complete tasks, procedures are prescriptive ways to\ncomplete tasks. In other words, while techniques allow for deviation and adjustment based on circumstance,\nprocedures are to be followed exactly as laid out with no deviation.\n2-9. Sometimes Army forces must apply some aspects of doctrine prescriptively\u2014done without deviation.\nPrescriptive doctrine derives from the need to\u2014\n\uf06c Adhere to the Army Ethic, laws of war, national law, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and\noften Army regulations.\n\uf06c Precisely use terms, symbols, and the language of the profession to ensure a common\nunderstanding.\n\uf06c Adhere to control measures to ensure coordination, ensure synchronization, and prevent fratricide.\n\uf06c Use report, message, and order formats to ensure information is reported rapidly, accurately, and\nin a commonly understood manner.\n2-10. The five types of information in Army doctrine represent a set of guidelines or tools that can be\ncombined in an almost infinite set of combinations to accomplish missions. Using the same approach or the\nsame set of tools consistently often makes operations predictable, providing an enemy with valuable insights\ninto methods to defeat a particular approach. The application of doctrine requires creative thinking. Doctrine\nis much more about knowing how to think about the conduct of operations than it is about what to think.\nDoctrine is a starting point for determining how to accomplish missions and how to adjust and react to\nchanging circumstances. Applied blindly, it becomes a straightjacket. Applied with judgment, it allows\ncommanders and staffs to take advantage of the collected wisdom of the profession.\n2-2 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Doctrine in Context\nGENERAL TYPES OF DOCTRINE\n2-11. The Army recognizes four general types of doctrine:\n\uf06c Joint doctrine.\n\uf06c Multinational doctrine.\n\uf06c Multi-Service doctrine.\n\uf06c Service doctrine.\n2-12. Army doctrine exists within a larger set of doctrine publications. In theory, this is also a hierarchy in\nwhich the higher-level doctrine should drive the lower-level doctrine. Lower-level doctrine should in turn be\nconsistent with the higher-level doctrine. However, there are exceptions. Sometimes lower-level doctrine\ndrives higher-level doctrine. The delineations beginning in paragraph 2-13 are listed roughly in hierarchical\norder, highest to lowest (although joint and multinational doctrine are often co-equal in the hierarchy).\n2-13. Joint doctrine is fundamental principles that guide the employment of United States military forces in\ncoordinated action toward a common objective and may include terms, tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(CJCSI 5120.02D). By Federal law, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs is responsible for developing\ndoctrine for the joint employment of the armed forces. Joint doctrine broadly covers the strategic and\noperational levels of war and is (only by exception) tactical in nature. U.S. joint doctrine provides the\noverarching joint context for multi-Service doctrine.\n2-14. Multinational doctrine is the agreed upon fundamental principles that guide the employment of forces\nof two or more nations in coordinated action toward a common objective (JP 3-16). The North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) is the only organization that writes true multinational doctrine and largely fills the\nsame niche as U.S. joint doctrine. When operating in a NATO context, U.S. forces follow NATO doctrine.\n2-15. Multi-Service doctrine contains principles, terms, TTP used and approved by the forces of two or more\nServices. It performs a common military function consistent with approved joint doctrine. A publication\ncontaining this doctrine is called a multi-Service publication\u2014a publication containing principles, terms,\ntactics, techniques, and procedures used and approved by the forces of two or more Services to perform a\ncommon military function consistent with approved joint doctrine (CJCSM 5120.01A). Multi-Service\npublications are treated as Service doctrine. A multi-Service publication has a Service doctrine publication\nnumber on it for each Service that has agreed to it.\n2-16. Service doctrine is those publications approved by a single Service for use within that Service.\nThis doctrine provides fundamental principles that guide the employment of Service forces in coordinated\naction toward a common objective and may include (as Army doctrine does) TTP, terms, and symbols. Each\nService publishes its own doctrine publications under various nomenclatures. Paragraphs 2-18 through 2-25\ndiscuss types of Army doctrine.\n2-17. Army doctrine follows joint doctrine to a large extent. Some variation exists as each domain (land, air,\nmaritime, space, and cyberspace) has different requirements for some doctrine constructs and terms. As a\nrule, Army forces must use terms and control measures to issue orders from joint headquarters to Army\nechelons exactly as stated in joint publications (these terms and control measures are prescriptive). Beyond\nthat, Army doctrine mirrors joint doctrine wherever possible to facilitate interoperability and common\nunderstanding. When joint terms and constructs are not adequate for large-scale ground combat, Army\ndoctrine will vary, but only enough to account for the unique nature of large-scale ground combat. When it\ndoes vary, Army doctrine points out that it varies and why. When an Army echelon acts as a joint\nheadquarters, it implements joint doctrine if available. Army doctrine does not repeat joint doctrine but refers\nto the appropriate joint publication for details.\nTYPES OF ARMY DOCTRINE AND THEIR HIERARCHY\n2-18. From 1939 to 1999, all Army doctrine was contained in field manuals. Before that, Army doctrine was\npublished in drill manuals and field service regulations (FSRs). For a short time in the 2000s, the Army also\nused field manuals interim (known as FMIs) and Army tactics, techniques, and procedures (known as\nATTPs). Currently all Army doctrine fits into three types of publications, each with a different purpose:\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 2-3",
            "Chapter 2\n\uf06c Army doctrine publications.\n\uf06c Field manuals.\n\uf06c Army techniques publications.\n2-19. Army doctrine publications (known as ADPs) contain the fundamental principles. Operating forces\nand elements of the institutional force that directly support operations use these publications to guide their\nactions in support of national objectives. An Army doctrine publication provides the intellectual\nunderpinnings of how the Army operates as a force.\n2-20. Field manuals (known as FMs) contain principles, tactics, procedures, and other doctrinal information.\nArmy forces use these publications to understand how the Army and its organizations conduct and train for\noperations. Field manuals describe how the Army executes operations described in the Army doctrine\npublications. They fully integrate and comply with the doctrine in the Army doctrine publications.\n2-21. Army techniques publications (known as ATPs) contain techniques. Army forces use these\npublications to accomplish missions, complete functions, and perform specific tasks. Army techniques\npublications provide Soldiers with ways or methods to accomplish or complete a mission, task, or function.\nThe technique publications provide Soldiers with the flexibility to accomplish or complete a mission, task,\nor function without prescribing to them on what they must do. These publications fully integrate, nest, and\ncomply with the doctrine contained in Army doctrine publications and field manuals.\n2-22. These publication types form a doctrine hierarchy related to the conduct of operations (the hierarchy\ndoes not establish precedence for doctrine over other types of publications such as Army regulations and\noperator\u2019s manuals). Two capstone publications\u2014ADP 1, The Army, and ADP 3-0, Operations\u2014sit at the\ntop of the doctrine hierarchy. Below these capstone publications are the remaining Army doctrine\npublications. The next levels down are the field manuals followed by Army techniques publications. The\nhierarchy establishes which publication Soldiers reference when a conflict exists between publications. In\nshort, Army doctrine publications take precedence over field manuals, which take precedence over Army\ntechniques publications. This precedence only comes into play if a conflict arises between or among\npublications in different categories.\nNote. Not all higher-level publications have corresponding lower-level publications. Nor does\nevery lower-level publication have a specific higher-level publication under which it falls.\n2-23. The hierarchy makes it easier to determine what a professional needs to know. It allows Soldiers to\ntrace a body of knowledge from general to specific, getting more and more detail about any given topic as\none topic progresses from Army doctrine publications to field manuals to specific topics in Army techniques\npublications. The breakout of principles from TTP makes it easier to change publications incrementally. The\ntop tiers should change less frequently while Army techniques publications can change more rapidly as\ntechniques evolve.\n2-24. Although doctrine as a whole represents the Army\u2019s professional body of knowledge on the conduct\nof operations, no one is expected to be an expert in all of it. Ideally, Army professionals serve as experts in\nthe doctrine that relates to the Army as a whole as well as in that doctrine that pertains directly to their levels\nof responsibility, their branch and functional areas, and their assignments. In addition, every officer and\nnoncommissioned officer should know which doctrine publications discuss the conduct of different types of\noperations and how to access those publications in the event that unforeseen circumstances put them in an\noperation that differs from their personal experience, training, and education.\nCONCEPTS AND DOCTRINE\n2-25. Army professional often confuse concepts and doctrine. Concepts are ideas for a significant change.\nDoctrine is validated principles, TTP, and terms and symbols that the force can apply. The Administrative\nAssistant to the Secretary of the Army authenticates doctrine. Doctrine focuses on the art of the possible for\nArmy forces currently fielded, trained, and equipped or will be in the immediate, foreseeable future. Doctrine\nstarts from what is already known to work and what has been demonstrated to work beyond current practices\n(for example, it has been demonstrated to be effective by operations, experiments, training, and so on). The\n2-4 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Doctrine in Context\nArmy builds doctrine from lessons learned and the accumulated knowledge of the profession. Units\nconducting operations use doctrine, not concepts.\nCONCEPTS\n2-26. As ideas for a significant change, concepts are based on proposed new approaches to the conduct of\noperations or technology. These ideas propose how the force might do something significantly different in\nthe future, usually 5 to 15 years hence. Ideally, concepts start with a problem for which the current\nDOTMLPF solutions either do not work or prove inadequate. Although concepts are not bound by current\ndoctrine or technology, concept developers should start with a clear understanding of what doctrine says on\na topic and what technology can reasonably be expected to do. A concept proposes a significantly different\nway to conduct operations. Each concept then becomes the focus for evaluation to validate or invalidate\nmajor changes. When the Army validates a concept, or part of a concept, it may become the driver for a\nchange in any of the DOTMLPF areas.\n2-27. Not all concepts result in a change to current practices, but the validation process is almost as valuable.\nKnowing what does not work after thorough analysis can prevent a seemingly good idea from becoming an\nactual problem. Haste in adopting unproven concepts can result in major disruptions that are\ncounterproductive. Pushing concepts into DOTMLPF solutions before vetting them thoroughly often results\nin wasted resources and can result in failed operations. Failure to adopt validated concepts can lock the Army\ninto less than optimum solutions at best and into ineffective practices at worst.\nCHANGING DOCTRINE\n2-28. Doctrine has never been static nor should it be. It must change to account for changing circumstances.\nWhile some publications have had longer shelf lives than others have, all are subject to change and almost\nall have been changed over their life span. For example, the Army\u2019s capstone doctrine\u2014Field Service\nRegulations Operations, FM 100-5 (now obsolete), FM 3-0, and then ADP 3-0\u2014has gone through 22 editions\nsince 1905. The average time between versions is about five years. The shortest time between versions was\nless than a year on five occasions. The longest time between editions was sixteen years (1923\u20131939).\n2-29. Doctrine changes when practice changes. Changes in practice are driven by changes in an operational\nenvironment. Changes occur for any number of reasons: changing threats, updated technology, redesigned\norganization, new and more effective ways to perform tasks, and even evolving budget and political\ndecisions. Two broad drivers prompt changes in doctrine; each has a different urgency associated with it.\nFirst, a change in the threat and its conduct of warfare demands rapid\u2014often immediate\u2014change. This\nchange can occur in almost any of the DOTLMPF categories but often requires a change in doctrine. Such\nchange ranges from a change in national strategy to a change at the lowest level of techniques. Changing to\nreact to an adaptable enemy is not optional. Second, changes to any of the DOTMLPF categories may be\ngenerated internally based on a better way or means to perform tasks. These changes only take place when a\nnew approach shows significant value added over the current solution. The doctrine domain is particularly\nsusceptible to change when a new and more effective way to perform some task becomes evident. These\nchanges often originate as local best practices or lessons learned. Best practices and lessons learned are\nsometimes (incorrectly) called techniques, but only those that become doctrine (authenticated) are truly\ntechniques.\n2-30. Any change in doctrine should result in changed behavior in operating forces. Any change\u2014no matter\nhow small\u2014takes resources. Not all changes are truly significant, yet they all generate a need to expend\nresources when adopting the change and eliminating the old behavior. Since an institution only has so much\nenergy to devote to change, worthwhile change must add significant value to the conduct of operations.\nChange for the sake of change is counter-productive; it wastes valuable resources. Change to respond to a\nchanging environment is mandatory, but changes that reflect small nuances in doctrine, such as renaming\nexisting constructs or adding adjectives to established terms, rarely have much effect and should be avoided.\nBalancing change with the ability of the force to accommodate it is an art. Every change in doctrine has the\nfollowing effects on the force:\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 2-5",
            "Chapter 2\n\uf06c The Army must disseminate the change to the force. It often takes one to three years for the force\nto fully understand a major change.\n\uf06c Operating forces must study and adopt the change; the institutional force must change programs\nof instruction. Everyone must become proficient at the change.\n\uf06c Leaders and Soldiers must understand what has been rescinded from doctrine.\n\uf06c Finally, it takes time for a change to permeate the force (often up to five years). Until every person\n(or unit) affected by the change adopts the change, the common operational approach and common\nlanguage required for effective operations is at risk.\n2-31. Change in doctrine takes both time and other resources. When driven by a change in threat activity,\nchanges in doctrine are necessary. When driven by internal changes to processes, changes in doctrine are\noptional. Proponents of doctrine must ask if the resources required to implement the change are worth the\nvalue added from the change.\n2-32. Doctrine is inherently conservative. Unlike some enterprises that can afford to spend significant\nresources on a myriad of projects in the hope of a huge payoff (such as venture capitalists), the Army cannot\nafford to risk lives on speculation. It is difficult to determine the effectiveness of a new idea in the absence\nof actual operations. Thus, changes to DOTMLPF tend to occur in incremental rather than revolutionary\nmodifications. Often the most important change brought about by a new technology is not the technology\nitself but the doctrine that applies it. Balancing the technology with the doctrine that implements it is one of\nthe great challenges with doctrine.\n2-33. The different constructs of doctrine\u2014principles, tactics, techniques, and procedures\u2014have different\nrates of change. True fundamental principles should be time tested and relatively long lasting. Many Army\nfundamental principles have been derived from centuries of warfare and are grounded in the human nature\nof war. Tactics also have a long lineage and often reflect relatively unchanging, basic ways to perform\nspecific tasks. While influenced by technology, tactics often use new technology to improve, speed up, or\nrefine the basic approach. In some cases, a new technology or simply an innovation in doctrine significantly\nalters tactics, even while those changing tactics adhere to the fundamentals. Techniques and procedures, on\nthe other hand, often change rapidly as new ways to perform a specific task, or even entirely new tasks, enter\nthe inventory.\n2-6 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Chapter 3\nFoundations of Doctrine\nWar is not for waging but for winning. Armies do not get paid to come second, not least\ndue to the severe penalties incurred in losing. Useful military theories relate to winning.\nWe want things that work; not merely things that are elegant or intellectually pleasing.\nJim Storr\nThe Human Face of War\nOUR VISION OF WAR\u2014THE NATURE OF OPERATIONS\n3-1. Army doctrine is grounded in a specific view of war and warfare. War is a constant\u2014a violent clash\nbetween two or more forces. While the term war has been used within the political area (the war on drugs,\nwar on poverty, economic warfare), it is the use of violence to achieve political purposes that distinguishes\nwar in the military context from other human activities. Such violence between forces on a large scale (as\nopposed to the criminal use of violence) and the risk that such violence imposes on the military distinguishes\nwar from other human endeavors. This distinction accounts for three elements of the Army\u2019s vision of war:\nit is inherently chaotic, it is a human endeavor, and it takes place among populations.\nWAR AS INHERENTLY CHAOTIC\n3-2. War is inherently chaotic. The number of moving parts, the intensive interaction of these parts on each\nother, and two or more sides actively working to interfere with the functioning of the other side make for a\ncomplex, chaotic environment. Orders can be and will be misunderstood, units will take wrong turns,\nobstacles will appear, and units will consume supplies at unexpected rates. This is the friction that Clausewitz\nso eloquently captured in On War. This chaotic nature of war makes precise cause-and-effect determinations\ndifficult, impossible, or delayed. The unintended effects of operations often cannot be seen ahead of time and\nmay not be readily apparent in real time. Such chaos imposes a great deal of uncertainty in all operations.\nThis demands an approach to the conduct of operations that does not attempt to impose perfect order on\noperations but that accepts the chaotic and uncertain nature of operations and makes allowances to account\nfor this unpredictability. Doctrine must not only clearly acknowledge and account for the complexity, chaos,\nand uncertainty of war, but it must provide a means to use these characteristics to benefit friendly forces and\nto exploit them for an asymmetric advantage.\nWAR AS A HUMAN ENDEAVOR\n3-3. War is a human endeavor\u2014a fundamentally human clash of wills. It is not a mechanical process that\ncan be controlled precisely, or even mostly, by machines, statistics, or laws that cover operations of carefully\ncontrolled and predictable environments. Fundamentally, all war is about changing human behavior. It is\nboth a contest of wills and a contest of intellect between two or more sides in a conflict, with each trying to\nalter the behavior of the other side. Success in operations is often determined by a leader\u2019s ability to outthink\nan opponent. While the bravery and sacrifice of Soldiers is essential to victory, it can rarely overcome poor\ndecisions against a competent, adaptive enemy. The side that forecasts better, adapts more rapidly, thinks\nmore clearly, decides and acts more quickly, and can comfortably operate with uncertainty stands the greatest\nchance to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative over an opponent.\n3-4. But war is much more than just a contest of wills; it is also the province of fear, passion, camaraderie,\nheroism, and grief. These emotions, and many others, affect the conduct of war. They affect how and when\nleaders decide to persevere and when to give up. Doctrine must acknowledge and account for human nature\nenabling leaders to conduct operations that take full advantage of their capabilities and to predict their\nenemies\u2019 potential reactions to friendly actions.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 3-1",
            "Chapter 3\nWAR AMONG PEOPLE\n3-5. All war takes place in and among populations, either directly or indirectly. Some fights occur in the\nmidst of large populations who are not combatants. Some operations take place in an environment in which\nthe welfare of the population becomes the responsibility of Army forces. Other operations are designed\nspecifically to influence a friendly, neutral, or enemy population to support or reject specific policies. And\nfinally, some operations aim only to relieve the suffering of populations beset by natural or man-made\ndisasters.\n3-6. For U.S. military forces, war is, or should be, about establishing or re-establishing two conditions.\nFirst, conditions favor United States\u2019 interests. Second, conditions enable the population to return to normal\npeacetime activities however that culture defines those activities. These two conditions apply to most, if not\nall, operations in which the U.S. Army has been involved. In large-scale conventional operations such as the\nworld wars, small-scale contingencies such as Granada and Panama, or long-term counterinsurgencies such\nas Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, the chaos of conflict, the clash of wills, the province of fear, passion, and\ncamaraderie, and the impact on populations and the impact of populations on operations, always exist. They\nrepresent the constants that characterize war.\nWARFARE IN DOCTRINE\n3-7. Warfare is about how war is conducted. While the nature of war is constant, warfare changes\nconstantly. Warfare is affected by changes in international law, technology, organizational structures,\noperational concepts, public opinion, national policy, and a host of other factors. Warfare may have\nsimilarities over time, but it will also have great variations. Doctrine has to account for the constants and then\nadapt warfare to the prevailing conditions in an operational environment.\n3-8. All these elements directly impact doctrine. The very fact that warfare is a constantly changing human\nendeavor means that doctrine should not and does not prescribe solutions to problems. It can only provide\ninsights on how to approach solutions. There is a place for checklists for some specific tasks. However,\nSoldiers do not solve most problems by recourse to checklists and standard solutions. Instead, they solve\nproblems by creatively applying various principles and TTP in unique combinations that address each\nproblem as a distinct situation whose solution can be informed by experience. The unpredictable nature of\nwarfare means Soldiers rarely use fixed solutions and more often use the flexible application of combat\npower, informed by experience and judgment. Thus, doctrine is a guide to action, not a template for action.\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF ARMY DOCTRINE\n3-9. The foundations of Army doctrine are a set of basic ideas grounded in the American vision of war and\nwarfare and guided by the Army Ethic, which in turn represents American moral and ethical values. Much\nof Army doctrine results from the Army Ethic. This professional ethos respects the inherent dignity and worth\nof all people and minimizes friendly casualties while avoiding harm to noncombatants. The American values\n(articulated in Army Values and the law of war) guide Army leaders in the conduct of operations. These ideas\nhave guided Army doctrine almost from the inception of the 1905 FSR. Three foundational ideas that have\nremained part of Army capstone publications from the beginning are the need for combined arms operations,\nthe need for mission command, and the need for adherence to the law of war. A fourth idea\u2014Army operations\ntake place within a context of joint, and now, unified actions partners\u2014is a more recent but central addition\nof Army doctrine. While the terms in paragraphs 3-10 through 3-13 may not have been used explicitly, the\nideas have consistently pervaded Army doctrine.\nCOMBINED ARMS OPERATIONS\n3-10. From the first capstone publication for the Army, 1905 FSR, the concept of combined arms was fully\nenshrined in doctrine. While the term combined arms operations was not used, the chapters on offense and\ndefense dealt specifically with the use of multiple arms simultaneously. The Army rapidly revised these\nmanuals with four new versions\u2014with multiple changes for each\u2014from 1910 to the post World War I 1923\nversion. Each new revision included an expanded array of capabilities to include armor, air, and a wireless\nmeans of command and control. By the 1914 version, the following sentence was included in the introduction:\n\u201cSuccess in war can be achieved only by all branches and arms of the service mutually helping and supporting\n3-2 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Foundations of Doctrine\none another in the common effort to attain the desired end.\u201d The 1914 version also had a whole section on\n\u201cUse of the Combined Arms.\u201d Every capstone manual since then has carried this idea forward.\nMISSION COMMAND\n3-11. Mission command as the approach to commanding and controlling Army forces is grounded in the\nArmy\u2019s understanding of the nature of warfare. The basic ideas of mission command have been part of every\ncapstone publication since 1905. The term itself is relatively new in doctrine, but the idea is not. The 1905\nFSR included these sentences: \u201cAn order should not trespass on the province of the subordinate. It should\ncontain everything which is beyond the independent authority of the subordinate, but nothing more\u2026. It\nshould lay stress upon the object to be attained, and leave open the means to be employed.\u201d By 1914, this\nhad been expanded to include\u2014\nOfficers and men of all ranks and grades are given a certain independence in the execution\nof the tasks to which they are assigned and are expected to show initiative in meeting the\ndifferent situations as they arise. Every individual, from the highest commander to the\nlowest private, must always remember that inaction and neglect of opportunities will\nwarrant more severe censure than an error in the choice of the means.\nThe idea of telling subordinates what to accomplish, not how to do it, and then relying on the initiative of\nsubordinates is fundamental to Army doctrine and has been consistently stated since the 1905 FSR. This idea\nfollows directly from the Army view of war as chaotic. Only leaders allowed the latitude to determine how\nto accomplish missions and empowered to make decisions can react quickly and effectively to changing\ncircumstances. Only leaders allowed the latitude to act proactively can take advantage of opportunities and\nreact quickly and effectively to threats to mission accomplishment.\nADHERENCE TO LAW OF WAR STANDARDS AND CIVILIAN CONTROL\n3-12. The 1905 FSR included the entire General Orders 100 titled \u201cInstructions for the Government of the\nArmies of the United States in Time of War.\u201d This comprehensive guide written during the American Civil\nWar gave instructions for appropriate treatment of civilians and prisoners of war. This document was the\nfoundation for the current Geneva Conventions. The 1905 FSR reprinted the entire General Orders 100. The\nnext three FSRs included extracts from The Hague Convention and later the Geneva Convention. As doctrine\nmatured over the decades, additional guidelines that govern actions of Soldiers have been developed, all\ndesigned to ensure actions comply with international and United States\u2019 laws, United States\u2019 societal values,\nand those values that guide the profession of arms. These guidelines include, but are not limited to\u2014\n\uf06c The Army Ethic.\n\uf06c The Code of Conduct.\n\uf06c The law of war.\n\uf06c The oaths of office.\n\uf06c Rules of engagement and rules for the use of force.\n\uf06c The Soldier\u2019s Creed.\n\uf06c The Warrior Ethos.\n(See the Army website https://www.army.mil/values/ for many of these guidelines.)\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 3-3",
            "Chapter 3\nJOINT OPERATIONS\n3-13. The 1923 FSR noted the importance of the air component of the Army in the conduct of combined\narms operations. Since World War I, all military operations have been conducted with multinational (alliance\nand coalition) partners. By the 1949 FM 100-5, in the wake of World War II, the discussion of amphibious\noperations was couched in terms of joint operations. The 1954 FM 100-5 acknowledged unified commands,\nspecified commands, and other commands or joint task forces that an appropriate authority might establish.\nIt also directed readers to see FM 110-5, Joint Action Armed Forces (now obsolete), for additional details on\nthe organization and functions of the Army. Since 1954, all Army capstone manuals have acknowledged that\noperations always take place in a joint environment. Lately, the idea of combined arms has gradually\nexpanded to include not only joint and multinational, but also interagency, intergovernmental, and\nnongovernmental partners as critical to the conduct of operations.\n3-4 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Chapter 4\nTaxonomies and Terms of Army Doctrine\nDefine your terms\u2026or we shall never understand one another.\nVoltaire\nDictionnaire Philosophique\nDOCTRINE FRAMEWORK\n4-1. The Army creates doctrine for the conduct of operations that accounts for the Army\u2019s view of the\nnature of war. We use taxonomies (the classification of things or concepts) to organize thoughts about the\nconduct of operations. They provide a conceptual framework to help Soldiers understand an operational\nenvironment; to organize and guide thinking about operations; to visualize how to move from the current\nstate to the desired end state; to derive the tasks, missions, and other responsibilities assigned to units; and to\nassess both plans and the execution of operations. They are aids for thinking about and conducting operations.\nThe terms of Army doctrine should facilitate, not constrain, that thinking.\n4-2. Effective Soldiers understand what each element of the doctrine framework is designed to do. Each\nelement requires both a definition of the term or taxonomy and a purpose for which it exists. Soldiers\nunderstand the interrelationships of the elements to the overall framework and to the other terms and\ntaxonomies\u2014their contributions to the Army\u2019s approach to the conduct of operations. The basic questions\nfor each element are \u201cWhat does this do to help Soldiers plan, prepare for, execute, and assess operations? Is\nthe term clear? Is it understandable? Will it survive the test of time or is it transitory?\u201d If doctrine cannot\nanswer these questions convincingly, then the term or taxonomy is probably unnecessary.\n4-3. The Army uses major terms and taxonomies to describe how Army forces conduct operations. As such,\ncommanders and staffs should understand and be able to use each of these terms or taxonomies in the conduct\nof operations.\nTERMS TO DESCRIBE ORGANIZATIONS AND BRANCHES\n4-4. Certain terms describe organizations and branches. The role defines the broad and enduring purpose\nfor which an organization or branch is established. Core competencies define the overall capabilities of an\norganization or branch to the Army, while the Army\u2019s core competencies explain the Army\u2019s contribution to\nthe nation\u2019s defense. A function describes a set of subordinate tasks and systems needed to accomplish the\nrole. Characteristics describe the attributes that the organization or branch requires to be effective, while\nprinciples are guidelines for the employment of an organization or branch. By applying the functions, guided\nby characteristics and principles, an organization or branch generates effects in the unique environment of\nthe land domain to support the Army\u2019s operational concept (the latter two terms are also used to describe\noperational environments and the conduct of operations; they are defined in paragraphs 4-12 and 4-18\nrespectively).\nROLE\n4-5. A role is the broad and enduring purpose for which the organization or branch is established.\nAn organization or branch has only one role. The purpose of a role is to clearly establish why the organization\nor branch was created\u2014what it uniquely contributes to the conduct of operations. Roles apply primarily to\norganizations or branches. Organizations refer to the units of operating forces, from theater armies down to\nsquads. Every organization or branch is designed to fulfill a role. This would often be the definition of the\norganization or branch. For example, \u201cThe role of air defense artillery is to provide fires to protect the force\nand selected geopolitical assets from aerial attack, missile attack, and surveillance.\u201d This is not a mission\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 4-1",
            "Chapter 4\nbecause it does not contain when and where the air defense artillery is to provide fires (see paragraph 4-34\nfor a discussion of mission).\nCORE COMPETENCIES\n4-6. A core competency is an essential and enduring capability that a branch or an organization\nprovides to Army operations. A branch or organization can have more than one core competency. The\npurpose of a core competency is to provide a clear statement of what a branch or organization does in broad,\neasily understood, general terms. The Army core competencies are the Army\u2019s essential and enduring\ncapabilities that define the Army\u2019s fundamental contributions to the Nation\u2019s security. The purpose of\nthe Army\u2019s core competencies is to provide a clear statement of what the Army does in easily understood,\ngeneral terms derived from Title 10, United States Code and DODD 5100.01. Core competencies drive how\nthe Army organizes, trains, and equips the force. Core competencies explain to both internal and external\naudiences what the Army, a branch, or an organization contributes to the Nation\u2019s security and to joint force\ncommanders. A core competency is not a task; it is a capability stated in general terms.\nFUNCTION\n4-7. A function is the broad, general, and enduring role for which an organization is designed, equipped,\nand trained (JP 1). The purpose of a function is to delineate the set of executable capabilities that an\norganization or branch requires to accomplish its role. A function can be a warfighting function, or some\nother grouping of tasks and systems, simply grouped by a common purpose. A function might have\nsubordinate groupings of tasks and systems that themselves form a function. The sustainment warfighting\nfunction has subordinate functions of logistics, personnel service support, and health services support. The\nArmy does not label these as sub functions; they are just functions. Most tasks that compose a function can\nbe used as a task in a mission statement (see paragraph 4-34 for discussion on mission and mission statement).\nCHARACTERISTIC\n4-8. A characteristic is a feature or quality that marks an organization or function as distinctive or is\nrepresentative of that organization or function. The purpose of a characteristic is to clearly establish\nessential attributes that the organization or function must possess to be effective. A characteristic is inherent\nin the design, mind-set, and equipment for an organization or function and gives that organization or function\nits unique ability to accomplish its role.\nPRINCIPLE\n4-9. A principle is a comprehensive and fundamental rule or an assumption of central importance\nthat guides how an organization approaches and thinks about the conduct of operations (see paragraph\n2-3). The purpose of a principle is to capture broad and enduring guidelines for the employment of an\norganization or function.\nTERMS TO DESCRIBE AN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT\n4-10. The terms discussed in paragraphs 4-11 through 4-16 are used to describe an operational environment.\nDOMAIN\n4-11. Merriam-Webster Dictionary has two definitions for domain that apply to doctrine: \u201ca territory over\nwhich dominion is exercised\u201d and \u201ca sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity.\u201d The purpose of a domain\nis to provide useful constructs to aid in\u2014\n\uf06c Describing general areas of knowledge.\n\uf06c Visualizing and characterizing the environment in which forces conduct operations.\nThe first definition applies specifically to leadership (domains of knowledge: tactical, technical, joint, and\ncultural and geopolitical) and training (training domains: operational, institutional, and self-development).\nThe second definition refers to an operational domain\u2014a territory over which the armed forces attempt to\n4-2 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Taxonomies and Terms of Army Doctrine\nachieve dominion (domination). These physical domains consist of air, land, maritime, space and cyberspace.\nThe factors of an operational environment (expressed in terms of the operational and mission variables) reside\nin these domains (see paragraphs 4-14 through 4-16 which discuss these variables). While the Army operates\nin and uses all domains (with significant presence in, and use of, the air and cyberspace domains), it\ndominates the land domain.\nLAND DOMAIN\n4-12. The land domain is the area of the Earth\u2019s surface ending at the high water mark and overlapping with\nthe maritime domain in the landward segment of the littorals (JP 3-31). The purpose of the land domain is to\ndistinguish the characteristics of an operational environment on land from the characteristics of other domains\nand those that significantly affect the conduct of operations. The majority (but not all) of the operational\nvariables that affect large-scale combat operations reside in the land domain. The land domain differs from\nthe other domains. These differences directly affect doctrine for land forces. The land domain differs due to\nthe following factors:\n\uf06c Its physical aspects vary much more than the other domains. The variety of landforms, climates,\nand elevations greatly affects mobility, sight lines, cover and concealment, and other factors more\nthan it affects the other domains. While the other domains have variations, the variety is much\nmore homogenous than the land domain.\n\uf06c Human beings live in the land domain. The density of the population on land directly affects the\nconduct of large-scale ground combat operations. The density of the population rarely impacts air,\nmaritime, space, or cyberspace domains. The physical presence of most humans on land makes\nlarge-scale combat operations depend on interactions with the population more than operations in\nthe other domains depend on interactions.\n\uf06c Large-scale combat operations typically involve a more complex set of organizations with many\nmore moving parts than do operations in the other domains. For example, moving 15,000 people\nin a naval task force may require orders to only a handful of platforms. Moving 15,000 people in\nan Army division involves thousands of vehicles and often individual Soldiers. Commanders at\nall echelons, and even individuals, have choices about when, where, and how to move and have\nto be informed about the movement. Whereas the Navy and Air Force typically employ dozens to\nhundreds of platforms in episodic contact with an enemy, land forces typically employ thousands\nof platforms and tens of thousands of Soldiers in sometimes constant contact with an enemy.\n\uf06c The number and variety of simultaneous actions by numerous different actors who constantly\ninteract with each other makes the land domain more complex and chaotic than other domains.\nActors with different objectives\u2014each affected by terrain, weather, populations, and\ngovernments\u2014produce many more decisions made by more individuals than other domains\nproduce.\n\uf06c Terrain and population directly affect Soldiers\u2019 movement and ability to generate combat power.\nThe terrain, population, and moving parts of an operational environment introduce another level\nof friction. This friction places greater demands on leaders at all levels, and even on individual\nSoldiers, to make decisions in the absence of perfect information.\nOPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT\n4-13. An operational environment is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that affect\nthe employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander (JP 3-0). It encompasses physical\nareas and factors of the domains and the information environment. The purpose of an operational\nenvironment is to aid in understanding the totality of factors, specific circumstances, and conditions that\nimpact the conduct of operations. This understanding enables leaders to better identify the problem; anticipate\npotential outcomes; and understand the results of various friendly, enemy, adversary, and neutral actions and\nthe effects these actions have in achieving the military end state. A description of an operational environment\nincludes all the factors that the commander and staff need to capture and understand to inform the conduct\nof operations. An operational environment differs from an area of operations. An area of operations is a\nspecific part of the land domain (see paragraph 4-37). An operational environment is the totality of factors\nthat affect what occurs in an area of operations. These factors may include events or actions that occur outside\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 4-3",
            "Chapter 4\nthe area of operations. A commander is responsible for (or owns) an area of operations. One cannot own an\noperational environment.\nOPERATIONAL VARIABLES AND MISSION VARIABLES\n4-14. Army leaders plan, prepare, execute, and assess operations by analyzing an operational environment\nin terms of the operational variables and mission variables. The methods in which these variables interact in\na specific situation, domain (air, land, maritime, space, or cyberspace), area of operations, or area of interest\ndescribe a commander\u2019s operational environment.\nOperational Variables\n4-15. Operational variables are a comprehensive set of information categories used to describe an\noperational environment. The categories are political, military, economic, social, information,\ninfrastructure, physical environment, and time (known as PMESII-PT). The purpose of operational variables\nis to provide a broad, general set of information categories that assist commanders and staffs in analyzing\nand developing a comprehensive understanding of an operational environment.\nMission Variables\n4-16. Mission variables are the categories of specific information needed to conduct operations. The\nmission variables are mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and\ncivil considerations (known as METT-TC). The purpose of mission variables is to provide a set of\ninformation categories focused on what commanders and staffs need to know to achieve situational\nunderstanding once assigned a mission. Commanders and staffs use mission variables as a filter to extract\ninformation from the operational variables that staffs need to conduct an operation and commanders need to\nexercise mission command.\nTERMS AND TAXONOMIES FOR THE CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS\n4-17. The terms discussed in paragraphs 4-18 through 4-38 specifically apply to the conduct of operations.\nThey relate directly to the operations process.\nOPERATIONAL CONCEPT\n4-18. The operational concept is a fundamental statement that frames how Army forces, operating as\npart of a joint force, conduct operations. It is the fundamental approach that underlies all operations. The\npurpose of the operational concept is to serve as a basic framework for all operations across the range of\nmilitary operations. As such, it is the core of doctrine. It guides the development of subordinate operational\nstructures and is the basic approach to all operations. The operational concept must be uniformly known and\nunderstood throughout the Army. It describes how Army forces adapt to meet the distinct requirements of\nlarge-scale combat operations. The operational concept should be broad enough to describe current\noperations and projected future operations, and flexible enough to apply in any situation worldwide. Unified\nland operations is the current operational concept. Previous operational concepts were full spectrum\noperations and AirLand Battle. The operational concept differs from capstone, operating, and functional\nconcepts (part of the capabilities development process) that deal with how future Army forces may operate\n(see paragraph 2-26). The operational concept underlies today\u2019s operations. It is the foundation of existing\ndoctrine.\nDECISIVE ACTION\n4-19. Decisive action is the continuous, simultaneous execution of offensive, defensive, and stability\noperations or defense support of civil authorities tasks (ADP 3-0). The purpose of decisive action is to ensure\nthat all major aspects of an operation are accounted for and that operations consider offensive, defensive, and\nstability or defense support of civil authorities tasks as inherent tasks in all operations. Decisive action ensures\nthat operations fully account for the impact of civilians on operations and their required support in an area of\n4-4 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Taxonomies and Terms of Army Doctrine\noperations. Decisive action also ensures that operations dominated by stability tasks do not overlook the\ninherent danger in all operations, by considering the need for offensive and defensive tasks.\nMISSION COMMAND\n4-20. Mission command is the Army\u2019s approach to command and control that empowers subordinate\ndecision making and decentralized execution appropriate to the situation (ADP 6-0). The purpose of mission\ncommand is to firmly inculcate within the Army the most effective means to account for the fog and friction\nof war, unleash the initiative of subordinates, and encourage rapid and effective decisions at the appropriate\nlevels in the execution of leadership and command. Commanders are responsible for establishing this\nphilosophy within their commands as well as training and educating their subordinates according to its\nprinciples.\nWARFIGHTING FUNCTION\n4-21. A warfighting function is a group of tasks and systems united by a common purpose that commanders\nuse to accomplish missions and training objectives (ADP 3-0). The Army\u2019s warfighting functions are\nfundamentally linked to the joint functions. A number of subordinate tasks, missions, and related capabilities\nhelp define each function; some apply to more than one function. The warfighting functions are the physical\nmeans that tactical commanders use to execute operations and accomplish missions assigned by superior\ntactical- and operational-level commanders. The purpose of warfighting functions is to provide an intellectual\norganization for common critical capabilities available to commanders and staffs at all echelons and levels\nof war. Commanders integrate and synchronize capabilities of one warfighting function with other\nwarfighting functions to achieve objectives and accomplish missions. These grouped and related capabilities\nand activities help commanders and staffs integrate, synchronize, and direct operations. Commanders and\nstaffs use the warfighting functions to ensure major groupings are accounted for in every operation and to\nconceptualize and apply capabilities to accomplish the mission through synchronizing forces and warfighting\nfunctions in time, space, and purpose. Combined arms operations use the capabilities of each warfighting\nfunction, along with leadership and information, in complementary and reinforcing capabilities.\nCOMBAT POWER\n4-22. Combat power is the total means of destructive, constructive, and information capabilities that a\nmilitary unit or formation can apply at a given time (ADP 3-0). Combat power has eight elements: leadership,\ninformation, command and control, movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection.\nThe last six elements are the warfighting functions. The purpose of combat power is to accomplish missions.\nIt also helps commanders conceptualize capabilities to execute combined arms operations.\nPRINCIPLES OF WAR AND PRINCIPLES OF JOINT OPERATIONS\n4-23. The principles of operations are time-tested general characteristics of successful operations that\nserve as guides for the conduct of future operations. Not prescriptive, they represent characteristics that,\nwhen accounted for in plans and execution, have proven to positively affect the outcome of operations. The\nprinciples of joint operations are the principles of war plus three recently added principles\u2014restraint,\nperseverance, and legitimacy. The purpose of the principles of joint operations is to provide commanders and\nstaffs a tool to analyze plans and operations to ensure critical characteristics have been accounted for or that\ntheir absence is deliberate and not a matter of oversight. They represent important factors that affect the\nconduct of operations across the levels of war. The principles are not a checklist. While commanders consider\nthe principles in all operations, the principles do not apply in the same way to every situation. Rather, they\nsummarize characteristics of successful operations. Their greatest value lies in educating the military\nprofessional. Applied to the study of past operations, the principles are powerful tools that can assist\ncommanders in analyzing pending operations. While considering the principles, commanders synchronize\nefforts and determine if or when to deviate from the principles based on the current situation.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 4-5",
            "Chapter 4\nTENETS OF OPERATIONS\n4-24. The tenets of operations are desirable attributes that should be built into all plans and operations\nand are directly related to the Army\u2019s operational concept. The purpose of the tenets is to provide\nplanners with criteria to evaluate whether plans and operations are designed to achieve the desirable\ncharacteristics.\nOPERATIONAL ART\n4-25. Operational art is the cognitive approach by commanders and staffs\u2014supported by their skill,\nknowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment\u2014to develop strategies, campaigns, and operations to\norganize and employ military forces by integrating ends, ways, and means (JP 3-0). The purpose of\noperational art is to provide a set of tools to formulate the most effective, efficient way to accomplish missions\nby the arrangement of actions in time, space, and purpose, and to overcome the ambiguity and intricacies of\na complex, ever-changing, and uncertain operational environment. Elements of operational art are individual\ncognitive tools that help the commander and staffs visualize and describe the broad operational approach.\nThe elements of operational art are intellectual tools that help commanders and staffs\u2014\n\uf06c Understand an operational environment and the problem or problems at hand during the Army\ndesign methodology.\n\uf06c Understand, visualize, and describe approaches for conducting the operation, to include the\nintegration and synchronization of the elements of combat power as well as their commander\u2019s\nintent and guidance.\n\uf06c Determine the most effective and efficient methods for applying decisive action in various\nlocations across multiple echelons.\n\uf06c Envision how to establish conditions that accomplish their missions.\n\uf06c Translate the operational approach into a concept of operations and ultimately into tactical tasks.\n\uf06c Help to integrate ends, ways, and means while accounting for risk.\nOPERATIONAL APPROACH\n4-26. An operational approach is a broad description of the mission, operational concepts, tasks, and actions\nrequired to accomplish the mission (JP 5-0). The purpose of an operational approach is to provide a\nframework that relates tactical tasks to the desired end state. It provides a unifying purpose and focus to all\noperations. It links conceptual planning with detailed planning by providing the main idea that outlines\ndetailed planning and guides the force through preparation and execution. The operational approach enables\ncommanders to begin visualizing and describing possible combinations of actions to reach the desired end\nstate, given the tensions identified in an operational environment and problem frames. The staff uses\noperational approaches to develop courses of action during detailed planning.\nOPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK\n4-27. An operational framework is a cognitive tool used to assist commanders and staffs in clearly\nvisualizing and describing the application of combat power in time, space, purpose, and resources in\nthe concept of operations. It provides a basis for decisions on allocating resources based on priorities and\ngeographical location of critical events. The purpose of an operational framework is to facilitate decisions\nabout when and where to apply resources, ensure the synchronization of subordinate tasks, and provide the\nmeans to shift priorities of support as situations change.\nOPERATIONS PROCESS\n4-28. The operations process is the major mission command and control activities performed during\noperations: planning, preparing, executing, and continuously assessing the operation (ADP 5-0). The purpose\nof the operations process is to provide a common, logical, inter-related set of processes that guide the conduct\nof operations. It is the basic underlying process that guides the employment of forces and ensures the\nsynchronization of all elements of combat power for the conduct of operations. The operations process\nprovides a flexible, adaptable set of activities capable of adjusting to changing circumstances and which\n4-6 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Taxonomies and Terms of Army Doctrine\nfacilitates a common approach to operations across all echelons and all environments. It is the operations\nprocess that allows commanders and staffs to synchronize and link all other components into a coherent and\nlogical plan and facilitates the execution of the plan through adaptation to changing circumstances.\nTHE LEVELS OF WARFARE\n4-29. The levels of warfare are a framework for defining and clarifying the relationship among national\nobjectives, the operational approach, and tactical tasks. The purpose of the levels of warfare is to focus a\nheadquarters on one of three broad roles\u2014creating strategy, synchronizing and sequencing battles and\nengagements, or conducting tactical tasks. The three levels of warfare\u2014strategic, operational, and tactical\u2014\ndefine and clarify the relationships among national objectives, the operational approach, and tactical actions.\nThey help commanders visualize a logical arrangement and synchronization of operations, allocate resources,\nand assign tasks to the appropriate command. The levels of warfare correlate to specific levels of\nresponsibility. They are about the tasks that commanders and staffs at various headquarters carry out to\nachieve goals set by political leaders. The levels of warfare should not be confused with effects\u2014which can\nalso be strategic, operational, or tactical and can be generated by any echelon, or even individuals. The fact\nthat an echelon or individual generates a strategic effect does not mean that the echelon or individual is\noperating at the strategic level of warfare. A simple technique (such as executing a search pattern and\nplanning a bombing run on an aircraft carrier at Midway) can have a theater strategic effect. But the pilot is\nnot determining how the instruments of national power are synchronized to accomplish political end states.\nStrategic Level\n4-30. The strategic level of warfare establishes national, theater, and multinational objectives (ends). It\nderives a foundational idea or set of ideas for employing the instruments of national power in a synchronized\nand integrated fashion to achieve these objectives (ways). It sequences initiatives and defines the limits of\nrisk in operations. It also provides the capabilities (means) used to accomplish these ends. Military strategy,\nderived from national policy and strategy and informed by doctrine, provides a framework for conducting\noperations. The strategic level of warfare is primarily the province of national leadership and geographic\ncombatant commands. It is expressed in national security, defense, and military strategies and joint doctrine.\nOperational Level\n4-31. The operational level of warfare links the tactical employment of forces to national and military\nstrategic objectives through the design of campaigns and major operations. It determines how, when, where,\nand for what purpose commanders will employ major forces to achieve assigned ends. It sequences and\nsynchronizes battles, engagements, and other operations (such as disaster relief and support to governance)\nto achieve operationally significant outcomes. Operational commanders position and maneuver forces to\nshape conditions for their decisive operation within their assigned operational areas. Commanders exploit\ntactical victories to gain strategic advantage or reverse the strategic effects of tactical losses. Operational-\nlevel headquarters determine objectives and provide resources for tactical operations. Operational art governs\nthe deployment of those forces and the arrangement of operations to achieve operational and strategic\nobjectives. The operational level of war is addressed in both joint and Service doctrine.\nTactical Level\n4-32. The tactical level of warfare is about the conduct of tactical actions, battles, engagements, and other\ntactical tasks to achieve military objectives assigned to tactical units or task forces. When all the tactical tasks\nassigned to tactical units are performed, they should accomplish operationally significant results. The tactical\nlevel of war is addressed primarily in Service doctrine.\nOPERATION\n4-33. An operation is a military action or the carrying out of a strategic, operational, tactical, service,\ntraining, or administrative military mission (JP 3-0). The purpose of an operation is to achieve an assigned\nobjective (end state) at the prescribed time and place by a specific unit. An operation is the carrying out of\nan assigned mission.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 4-7",
            "Chapter 4\nMISSION\n4-34. A mission is the task, together with the purpose, that clearly indicates the action to be taken and the\nreason therefore (JP 3-0). A mission statement always includes who (the organization), what (a task or tasks),\nwhen (time to accomplish the task), where (the place the task is to be accomplished, usually an area of\noperations), and why (purpose). The purpose of a mission is to assign a specific requirement for action to be\naccomplished by a unit. In doctrine, missions are only used when conducting operations. Organizations and\nfunctions do not have missions until they are employed. The generic, ongoing use that organizations have is\npart of their roles and functions. Thus a mission is something (a task\u2014action to be taken) that is assigned to\na unit to execute for a reason (the purpose)\u2014commonly abbreviated as task and purpose.\nTASK\n4-35. A task is a clearly defined action or activity specifically assigned to an individual or organization that\nmust be done as it is imposed by an appropriate authority (JP 1). A task may be collective or individual.\nCollective tasks specify what an organization or function is specifically intended to do, beyond the general\npurpose of its role. The purpose of a task is to clearly define a specific action or activity necessary to achieve\na specific end, either in training or on operations. For example, the role of infantry might be to close with\nand destroy the enemy through close combat. Tasks might then be to conduct maneuver to a position of\nadvantage, mass direct fires on a target, or conduct infiltration. Commanders and staffs use the Combined\nArms Training Strategies to identify collective or individual tasks to plan for unit training. (See the Army\nTraining Network website for Combined Arms Training Strategies, collective tasks, and individual tasks.)\nCONTROL MEASURE\n4-36. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions (ADP 6-0). The purpose of\ncontrol measures is to ensure a thorough understanding between and among echelons of duties and\nresponsibilities related to the conduct of operations. Control measures can be permissive or restrictive. When\nunderstood by all, they convey a great deal of information with simple words or graphics about what can or\ncannot be done in various circumstances or in various areas. Control measures greatly facilitate coordinating\nand synchronizing responsibilities for conducting operations.\nAREA OF OPERATIONS\n4-37. An area of operations is an operational area defined by a commander for land and maritime forces that\nshould be large enough to accomplish their missions and protect their forces (JP 3-0). For land operations,\nan area of operations includes subordinate areas of operations assigned by Service commanders as well. The\npurpose of an area of operations is to clearly delineate an area within which a specific commander has primary\nresponsibility for integrating and synchronizing the warfighting functions, clearing all uses, and controlling\nall effects. A commander has the authority to designate targeting priority, effects, and timing of all activities\nwithin his or her assigned area of operations, except when higher headquarters imposes specific operational\nlimitations.\nOPERATION ORDER OR PLAN\n4-38. An operation order is a directive issued by a commander to subordinate commanders for the purpose\nof effecting the coordinated execution of an operation (JP 5-0). An operation plan is an operation order that\nhas not been assigned a time for execution. The purpose of an operation order is to help leaders and staffs\nensure that all information necessary to execute the operation is accounted for and conveyed to subordinates\nin a format that facilitates their finding the information that pertains to them.\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPERATIONS AND WARFIGHTING\nFUNCTIONS\n4-39. Operations and the warfighting functions are closely connected but distinct from each other, both in\npurpose and in structure. The difference can be stated simply: An operation consists of the tasks required to\naccomplish a specific mission. In contrast, each warfighting function consists of tasks whose purpose is to\n4-8 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",
            "Taxonomies and Terms of Army Doctrine\nachieve the same effects, regardless of the situation. The operation order for a given mission contains tasks\nfrom each warfighting function necessary to accomplish the mission; however, the actions necessary to\nperform the tasks for a given warfighting function are the same, regardless of the mission.\n4-40. The purpose of the warfighting functions is to provide an intellectual organization of common\ncapabilities available to commanders and staffs to achieve objectives and accomplish missions. These\ncapabilities serve as the building blocks to generate combat power. Said another way, combat power is the\nactual physical incarnation of all the capabilities available to the commander for the conduct of operations.\nThus a warfighting function is an aggregation (a set) of capabilities used to produce results.\n4-41. An operation is a series of military actions to achieve assigned objectives and accomplish the mission.\nThe focus of an operation is an outcome. Commanders integrate the warfighting functions to generate and\nmaintain combat power to perform tasks, achieve objectives, and attain the operation\u2019s end state\u2014an\noutcome.\n4-42. In large-scale ground combat operations, generating and maintaining combat power is essential to\nsuccess. Commanders combine and apply the elements of combat power to produce overwhelming effects\nthroughout operations. In short, a warfighting function is a set of capabilities, whereas an operation is\ndesigned to produce an outcome that uses the capabilities provided by the warfighting function. Within most\nof the warfighting functions, there are tasks that can be used as a task to some formation (type of unit), which\nwhen combined with the when, where, and why constitute a mission to be executed by that unit\u2014that is, it\nbecomes an operation for that unit.\n4-43. The difference between these tasks and an operation is simple. For almost all tasks successful execution\nrequires use of all the warfighting functions in various combinations to achieve success. While there are some\nexceptions, the tasks listed under warfighting functions do not require all the other warfighting functions for\nsuccess. In fact, many of those tasks are staff tasks and not unit tasks. Even those that are unit tasks are rarely\ntasks that, when successfully executed, result in performance of a task that directly contributes to the end\nstate. In most cases, it contributes to a higher headquarters\u2019 task that further combines multiple tasks related\nto other warfighting functions.\n4-44. Another way to look at this is to think about how a given echelon routinely combines certain common\ntasks to accomplish missions. An artillery headquarters assigned a mission to conduct fire support (which\nconstitutes an operation for the artillery unit) will always need to carry out tasks associated with\u2014\n\uf06c Mission command (it must plan, prepare, execute, and assess the operation).\n\uf06c Movement and maneuver (it must move its firing units into location).\n\uf06c Intelligence (it needs targetable locations and identification of targets).\n\uf06c Protection (it must survive in a hostile environment).\n\uf06c Sustainment (it requires supplies of ammunition, replacement personnel, and so on).\nWhat it does not need are any of the tasks grouped under decisive action. Fires are a function used to conduct\noperations, not the operation itself.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 4-9",

            "Chapter 5\nApplication of Doctrine\nWith 2,000 years of examples behind us we have no excuse, when fighting, for not fighting\nwell.\nT. E. Lawrence\nquoted in The Liddell Hart Memoirs\nTHE RELATIONSHIPS\n5-1. The preceding chapters have discussed doctrine, its sources, its changes, and a number of tools and\ntaxonomies needed to understand and apply it. This chapter addresses topics related to understanding and\napplying doctrine. It is not enough to know terms and definitions. Army professionals must also understand\ntheir relationships\u2014how they fit together\u2014when applied to studying and more importantly to conducting\noperations. Part of this understanding comes from being able to compare and contrast terms and concepts to\nunderstand them and their use, as is done in chapter 4\u2019s discussion of operations and warfighting functions.\nDoctrine is central to helping leaders and Soldiers remain abreast of current thought and technology and to\napply Army capabilities to accomplish any mission they are assigned.\n5-2. Everything related to the conduct of operations is part of an operational environment, the one category\nthat accounts for all political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment,\nand time (known as PMESII PT or operational variables) considerations that influence operations and training\nfor operations. These variables need to be captured and continuously updated by analysis in running estimates\nand understood by the commander and staff even before the assignment of a mission. Operational variables\nmay reside in any of the domains (air, land, maritime, space, and cyberspace). Once a mission is assigned, a\ncommander and staff\u2019s analysis is framed by the mission variables (known as METT-TC), which narrows\ndown the operational variables to those that affect a specific mission.\n5-3. Once a mission is assigned, Army commanders and staffs have to understand their mission within the\ncontext of the land domain. Large-scale combat operations take place within a broader context that includes\nthe political arena, joint operations, and other Service operations. It is in the political arena and higher level\njoint headquarters, the strategic level of warfare, that the overall political and military objectives are defined.\nOnce the military objectives are defined, specific instructions are issued to joint task forces operating at the\noperational level of warfare, which in turn assign tasks to, among others, the land component. Understanding\nthis context is necessary to ensure that large-scale combat operations are part of a coherent and cohesive\nwhole.\n5-4. All large-scale ground combat operations take place within the context of a joint campaign.\nUnderstanding the joint structure and doctrine is required to fully understand the role of land forces in the\noverall campaign. Land operations begin with a mission assigned by a joint force commander to a land\ncomponent, or from one echelon within the land component to another at the tactical level of warfare. The\nreceipt of a mission starts the process of actually employing land forces.\n5-5. Once a mission is assigned or a prospective mission is determined, it starts the operations process that\nbrings everything together in a headquarters. Planning starts with the receipt of a mission and updating the\ncurrent understanding of an operational environment in which the mission will be accomplished. The higher\nheadquarters\u2019 operation order or plan creates a task organization that allocates resources to the command.\nThis task organization delineates the combat power the unit has to perform the assigned task.\n31 July 2019 ADP 1-01 5-1",
            "Chapter 5\nPLANNING\n5-6. Planning begins with an analysis and understanding of a specific operational environment filtered\nthrough the specific mission, which in turn determines which information elements of the operational\nvariables are carried over and filtered by the mission variables for analysis. A thorough understanding of an\noperational environment and assigned mission enables the commander and staff to envision a desired end\nstate and broad approach to achieve that end state using the elements of operational art. Through operational\nart and the principles of joint operations, commanders understand, visualize, and describe the integration and\nsynchronization of the elements of combat power to achieve objectives, attain end state conditions in broad\nterms, determine an operational approach, and describe their commander\u2019s intent and guidance. Commanders\nselectively use these tools in any operation. However, the tools\u2019 broadest application applies to long-term\noperations. The operational approach is determined in part by the combat power available to the commander.\nIt tells the commander what is the potential that can be translated into effects or actions. It is a measure of\nthe total capacity the commander has at his or her disposal. The critical issue here is always to know if the\ncombat power available is adequate to accomplish assigned missions. This is the conceptual stage of planning.\n5-7. The commander and staff then go into detailed planning to develop one or more courses of action.\nEach course of action will assign broad general tasks and priorities of support to each warfighting function.\nThese broad general tasks represent the major activities that constitute the building blocks for a course of\naction. Warfighting functions are the broad capabilities that must be accounted for in all operations. By\ndeveloping how each function contributes to attaining the end state (developing a scheme of support for each\nwarfighting function\u2014a scheme of maneuver, scheme of fires, scheme of sustainment, and so on), the\ncommander lays out a broad approach to move from the current state to the end state. The courses of action\nshould synchronize the warfighting functions in order to generate combat power.\n5-8. Allocation of resources is usually done through one of the operational frameworks. The operational\nframeworks provide a tool that helps commanders frame where to apply combat power (warfighting\nfunctions) to achieve specific effects. Commanders and staffs use the main and supporting efforts to indicate\nthe shifting of priorities of support by each warfighting function when the complexity of operations requires\nsequential application of combat power using phases or when circumstances require a change in the concept\nof operations. While developing and evaluating the courses of action, commanders and staffs use the\nprinciples of joint operations and the tenets of unified land operations as tools to assess whether or not courses\nof action account for important characteristics of operations that were effective, or are desired characteristics\nof current operations. Both principles and tenets should assist commanders and staffs in visualizing how to\nstructure a course of action and concept of operations.\n5-9. Commanders and staffs use the Army planning methodologies (Army design methodology, the military\ndecision-making process, and troop leading procedures) to analyze multiple courses of action to determine\nthe most suitable one. Once the commander approves a course of action, the remainder of the military\ndecision-making process determines the specific tasks assigned to subordinate units that will accomplish the\nmission in the area of operations and ultimately achieve the identified end state. These specific tactical tasks\ncome from the set of tasks of decisive action, the tactical tasks of offense, defense, and stability or defense\nsupport of civil authorities, and enabling tasks, and the subordinate tasks thereof. The end result of this\nprocess should be an operation order. The operation order will establish the relationship between mission,\ncommander\u2019s intent, and concept of operations. The operation order guides commanders\u2019 arrangement of\nwarfighting functions to mass the effects of combat power at the chosen place and time to overwhelm an\nenemy or dominate the situation.\n5-10. The best operation orders are mission orders. Mission orders are directives that emphasize to\nsubordinates the results to be attained, not how they are to achieve them (ADP 6-0). They facilitate mission\ncommand by providing subordinates with a clear commander\u2019s intent, latitude to determine how to\naccomplish missions, and flexibility to exercise disciplined initiative within the commander\u2019s intent.\n5-11. Mission command is essential in the land environment. It allows for more rapid decision-making at the\nlowest levels and best accounts for the fog, friction, and complexity of the land environment, maximizing\ncombat power over time. Mission command is essential to execute the Army\u2019s operational concept of unified\nland operations. The force cannot seize, retain, and exploit the initiative effectively without the disciplined\ninitiative of subordinates.\n5-2 ADP 1-01 31 July 2019",

            "Introduction\nThis revision of ADP 1-02 compiles definitions of all Army terms approved for use in Army doctrinal\npublications, including ADPs, FMs, and ATPs. It also includes joint terms appearing in the glossaries of\nArmy doctrinal publications as of March 2018. ADP 1-02 also lists shortened forms (whether considered\nacronyms or abbreviations) approved for use in Army doctrinal publications. In addition, ADP 1-02\nincorporates North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) terms appearing in the glossaries of Army doctrinal\npublications.\nThis publication is augmented by the Army Dictionary online. Changes to terminology occur more frequently\nthan traditional publication media can be updated. The terminology and symbology database, known as the\nArmy Dictionary, is updated monthly to reflect the latest editions of Army publications. (To access the\ndatabase, go to https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/index.jsp?pindex=207, and log in with a common access card.) This\ndatabase is an official Department of Defense (DOD) Web site, maintained by the Combined Arms Doctrine\nDirectorate in collaboration with the Joint Staff Directorate for Joint Force Development. The site is part of\nthe Joint Doctrine, Education, and Training Electronic Information System. It includes all Army doctrinal\nterms and all military symbols in MIL-STD 2525D, including air, land, maritime, space, activities control\nmeasures, and meteorological symbols. While the database includes the same joint terms appearing in\nADP 1-02, readers should consult the DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms for up-to-date joint\nterminology.\nADP 1-02 also provides a single standard for developing and depicting hand-drawn and computer-generated\nmilitary symbols for situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs for all types of military\noperations. It is the Army proponent publication for all military symbols, and it complies with Department\nof Defense (DOD) Military Standard (MIL-STD) 2525D. The symbology chapters of this ADP focus\nprimarily on military symbols applicable to Army land operations. When communicating instructions to\nsubordinate units, commanders and staffs from company through corps echelons should use this publication\nas a dictionary of operational terms and military symbols.\nADP 1-02 is organized as follows:\nChapter 1 presents terms.\nChapter 2 presents acronyms, abbreviations, and country codes.\nChapter 3 introduces military symbology fundamentals.\nChapters 4 through 7 provide icons for units, individuals, organizations, equipment, installations, and\nactivities.\nChapter 8 introduces control measure symbols.\nChapter 9 discusses tactical mission tasks.\nChapter 10 discusses the course of action sketch.\nThe terminology entries in chapter 1 of this publication fall into three categories:\nDefinitions applicable to the Army only.\nJoint (DOD) definitions commonly used in Army publications.\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) definitions commonly used in Army publications.\nFor each term and definition, a proponent publication is cited in parentheses after the definition.\nDefinitions applicable to the Army only. The Army definition is preceded by \u201c(Army)\u201d if the term also has\na joint definition that differs from the Army definition. (See the definition for \u201cattack position\u201d listed below.)\nIf the term has no associated joint definition, the Army definition is not preceded by \u201c(Army)\u201d. (See the\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 ix",
            "Introduction\ndefinition for \u201csituational understanding\u201d listed below.) All Army-unique definitions must be followed by\nthe proponent Army publication in parentheses, as in the following examples:\nattack position - (Army) The last position an attacking force occupies or passes through before crossing the\nline of departure. (ADRP 3-90)\nsituational understanding \u2013 The product of applying analysis and judgment to relevant information to\ndetermine the relationship among the operational and mission variables to facilitate decisionmaking.\n(ADP 5-0)\nDefinitions that are joint (DOD) and appear in the glossaries of Army publications. Each joint definition\nis preceded by \"(DOD).\" A cross-reference such as \"See ADRP X-YY\" follows the definition, signifying the\npublication discussing Army usage of the term, as in the following example:\nairspace control \u2013 (DOD) Capabilities and procedures used to increase operational effectiveness by\npromoting the safe, efficient, and flexible use of airspace. (JP 3-52) See ADRP 3-0, ADRP 3-90, ADRP 5-0,\nFM 3-52, and FM 3-90-1.\nDefinitions that are NATO and appear in the glossaries of Army publications. Each NATO definition is\npreceded by \"(NATO).\" A cross-reference such as \"See ADRP X-YY\" follows the definition, signifying the\npublication discussing Army usage of the term, as in the following example:\nexplosive ordnance disposal incident \u2013 (NATO) The suspected or detected presence of unexploded\nexplosive ordnance, or damaged explosive ordnance, which constitutes a hazard to operations, installations,\npersonnel or material. Not included in this definition are the accidental arming or other conditions that\ndevelop during the manufacture of high explosive material, technical service assembly operations or the\nlaying of mines and demolition charges. (STANAG 3680) See ATP 4-32.\nDOD and NATO terms with multiple definitions. The related definition number will precede the definition\nto denote the definition or definitions applicable to Army doctrine. For example the DOD term\n\u201cdemonstration\u201d has two different definitions (1 and 2) for this term, and the Army only uses definition\nnumber 2 in doctrine:\ndemonstration \u2013 (DOD) 2. In military deception, a show of force in an area where a decision is not sought\nthat is made to deceive an adversary. It is similar to a feint but no actual contact with the adversary is intended.\n(JP 3-13.4) See FM 3-90-1.\nIn addition, two other descriptors may appear after a definition:\nAlso called.\nSee also.\nAlso called. If a term has a shortened form (acronym or abbreviation) approved for doctrinal use, the\nshortened form appears after the definition, preceded by also called, as in the following example:\nafter action review \u2013 A guided analysis of an organization\u2019s performance, conducted at appropriate times\nduring and at the conclusion of a training event or operation with the objective of improving future\nperformance. It includes a facilitator, event participants, and other observers. Also called AAR. (ADRP 7-0)\nSee also. If related terms are defined elsewhere in ADP 1-02, they are cross-referenced after the definition.\nThe related terms are bolded and preceded by \"See also,\" as in the following example:\narea security \u2013 A security task conducted to protect friendly forces, installation routes, and actions within a\nspecific area. (ADRP 3-90) See also area reconnaissance, security operations.\nThe acronym and abbreviation entries listed in section I of chapter 2 are Army and joint. Shortened forms\napplicable only to Army doctrine are shown in boldface, to distinguish Army from joint usage. Acronyms\nare added to ADP 1-02 and the online \u201cArmy Dictionary\u201d when a defined term has an associated acronym or\nif an acronym has doctrinal cross branch or functional usage. The cross branch usage criterion for considering\nan acronym for inclusion is that it must appear in two or more doctrinal publications that are not branch\nspecific or related.\nx ADP 1-02 14 August 2018",
            "Introduction\nThe symbology chapters (chapters 3 through 10) provide detailed requirements for composing and\nconstructing symbols. The rules for building a set of military symbols allow enough flexibility for users to\ncreate any symbol to meet their operational needs. Although this publication serves as the Army proponent\nfor military symbols, within DOD MIL-STD 2525D is the proponent for military symbols. This publication\ncompiles control measure symbols. Readers can find defined terms used for symbology in chapter 1,\nincluding cross-references to publications that discuss usage of control measure symbols. All control measure\nsymbols in this publication are linked to doctrine.\nADP 1-02 is now the proponent of terms for which ADRP 1-02 had been the proponent.\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 xi",

            "Chapter 3\nMilitary Symbology Fundamentals\nThis chapter discusses framed symbols, locations of amplifiers, the bounding octagon,\nand the locations of icons and modifiers. It also discusses the building process for\nframed symbols and unframed symbols.\nFRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-1. A military symbol is a graphic representation of a unit, equipment, installation, activity, control\nmeasure, or tactical task relevant to military operations that is used for planning or to represent the common\noperational picture on a map, display, or overlay. Military symbols are governed by the rules in Military\nStandard (MIL-STD) 2525D. Military symbols fall into two categories: framed, which includes unit,\nequipment, installation, and activity symbols; and unframed, which includes control measure and tactical\nsymbols.\n3-2. A framed symbol is composed of a frame, color (fill), icon, modifiers, and amplifiers. Paragraphs 3-3\nthrough 3-13 discuss framed symbols.\nFRAME\n3-3. The frame is the border of a symbol. It does not include associated information inside or outside of the\nborder. The frame serves as the base to which other symbol components are added. The frame indicates the\nstandard identity, physical domains, and status of the object being represented.\nStandard Identity\n3-4. Standard identity reflects the relationship between the viewer and the operational object being\nmonitored. The standard identity categories are unknown, pending, assumed friend, friend, neutral, suspect,\nand hostile. In the realm of surface operation symbols, a circle or rectangle frame denotes friend or assumed\nfriend standard identity, a diamond frame denotes hostile or suspect standard identity, a square frame denotes\nneutral standard identity, and a quatrefoil frame denotes unknown and pending standard identity. Table 3-1\n(on page 3-2) shows frame shapes for standard identities for land symbols.\nPhysical Domain\n3-5. The physical domain defines the primary mission area for the object within the operational\nenvironment. An object can have a mission area above the earth\u2019s surface (in the air domain or space domain),\non the earth\u2019s surface, or below the earth\u2019s surface (that is, in the land domain or maritime domain). The land\ndomain includes those mission areas on the land surface or close to the surface (such as caves, mines, and\nunderground shelters). Maritime surface units are depicted in the sea surface dimension. Aircraft, regardless\nof Service ownership, can be depicted in either the air dimension (in flight) or land dimension (on the ground),\nwhile air units are depicted as a land unit and facilities as a land installation. Land equipment is depicted in\nthe land dimension. Likewise, landing craft whose primary mission is ferrying personnel or equipment to and\nfrom shore are represented in the sea surface dimension. However, a landing craft whose primary mission is\nto fight on land is a ground asset and is represented in the land dimension.\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 3-1",

Frame shapes for standard identities\nStandard Identity Friendly Hostile Neutral Unknown\nAssumed Friend Suspect Pending\nUnit\nLand equipment\nand sea surface\nAir\nSpace\nInstallation\nActivity\nStatus\n3-6. Status depicts whether an object exists at the location identified (status is \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cconfirmed\u201d),\nwill in the future reside at that location (status is \"planned\u201d or \u201canticipated\"), or is thought to reside at that\nlocation (\u201csuspected\u201d).

In framed symbols, color provides a redundant clue with regard to standard identity. The fill is the\ninterior area in a symbol. If color is not used, the fill is transparent. In unframed symbols (equipment), color\nis the sole indicator of standard identity, excluding text amplifiers. The default colors used to designate\nstandard identity are blue for friendly or assumed friend, red for hostile or suspect, green for neutral, and\nyellow for unknown or pending. Affiliation color without the fill may also be used for the frame, main icon,\nand modifiers.\nTHE OCTAGON\n3-8. The octagon serves as a three sector spatial reference for placement of main icons and modifiers in the\nframe of a symbol. The three sectors specify where main icons and modifiers are positioned and how much\nspace is available for sizing of main icons and modifiers. The vertical bounding octagon allows for effective\nuse of the space when dealing with vertical icons. Table 3-3 on page 3-4 provides examples showing the\nhorizontal and vertical bounding octagons examples for all frame shapes.\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 3-3",

The main icon is the innermost part of a symbol. The icon provides an abstract pictorial or\nalphanumeric representation of units, equipment, installations, or activities. This publication distinguishes\nbetween icons that must be framed and icons for which framing is optional. This indicator is represented as\nthe center area of field A/AA as defined in table 3-4 on page 3-7 through 3-9. For better readability, main\nicons may be \u201cenlarged\u201d to extend into any unused modifier sector.\n3-10. In general, main icons should not be so large as to exceed the dimensions of the main sector of the\noctagon or touch the interior border of the frame. However, there are exceptions to this size rule. In those\ncases the main icons will occupy the entire frame and must, therefore, exceed the dimensions of the main\nsector of the octagon and touch the interior border of the frame. These are called full-frame main icons and\n3-4 ADP 1-02 14 August 2018",

Example of full-frame main icons\nMODIFIERS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-11. A modifier provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric representation, displayed in conjunction with\na main icon. The modifier provides additional information about the icon (unit, equipment, installation, or\nactivity) being displayed. Modifiers conform to the octagon and are placed either above (in sector 1) or below\n(in sector 2) the main icon. This indicator is represented as the upper and lower part of field A/AA as defined\nin table 3-2 on page 3-3. This publication defines various types of modifiers and indicates where each is to\nbe placed in relation to the icon in the symbol frame.\nAMPLIFIERS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-12. An amplifier provides additional information about the symbol being portrayed and is displayed\noutside the frame. Figure 3-1 shows the essential amplifier fields around a friendly land unit symbol frame.\nTo avoid cluttering the display, only essential amplifiers should be used. Arabic numerals are normally used\nto show the unique designation of units. However, Roman numerals are used to show corps echelon units.\n3-13. The purpose of amplifier placement is to standardize the location of information. Figure 3-1 also\nillustrates the placement of amplifiers around a frame. The placement of amplifier information is the same\nregardless of frame shape. Table 3-4 (on pages 3-7 through 3-9) provides a description of amplifiers for\nframed symbols.\n3-14. Text (field AA, G, H, and T). When these amplifiers are displayed, they shall be defined in accordance\nwith the contents of table 3-4 on pages 3-7 through 3-9. Although text amplifiers are normally displayed\naround the symbol, the special C2 headquarters indicator (field AA as defined in table 3-4) is contained inside\nthe frame, as seen in figure 3-2 on page 3-6. Staff comments and additional information are contained in\nfields G and H, with the content of these fields being implementation specific so long as the maximum\nnumber of characters in each field is not exceeded. Air and space track numbers are included in field T.\n3-15. Direction of movement (field Q). The direction of movement amplifier is an arrow or staff\nidentifying the direction of movement or intended movement of an object. For land symbols, the amplifier is\nan angled arrow extending downward from the bottom center of the frame or icon and pointing in the direction\nof movement. For all other symbols, the amplifier is an arrow extending from the center of the frame or icon\nand pointing in the direction of movement (see figure 3-2 on page 3-6).\n3-16. Mobility indicator (field R). This indicator is only used for equipment. This indicator identifies\nmobility other than that intrinsic to the equipment itself. For example, the symbol for a self-propelled\nhowitzer moving by train would include a railway mobility indicator, while the symbol for a self-propelled\nhowitzer, a tank, or other tracked vehicle would not have a mobility indicator. The indicator is represented\nin field R as defined in table 3-4 on pages 3-7 through 3-9 and is positioned as shown in figure 3-2 on page\n3-6.\n3-17. Offset precise location (field S). The offset precise location indicator is used when placing an object\naway from its actual location, and it is a three point line extending from the anchor point of the symbol. Point\n1 is the anchor point of the offset symbol. Point 3 is the actual geographic location. Point 2 is an elbow\nbetween the symbol anchor point and the actual geographic location. See figure 3-2 on page 3-6.\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 3-5",
            "Chapter 3\n3-18. Speed (field Z). This field is used to display a unit or equipment velocity. The amplifier has a specific\nformat as described in paragraphs 3-19 and 3-20.\n3-19. The first part of this eight-character (its maximum length) amplifier shall be a numeric value (quantity)\nin the range 0 through 99999 or any combination of four or fewer digits and a significant decimal point.\nThere is a 5-character maximum for the numeric portion of this amplifier. There are specific allowable entries\nfor the numeric portion of this amplifier. The legal entries are a decimal point and numbers. The legal range\nof values for the numeric portion is zero (0) through 99999. The minimum length of this portion of the\namplifier is 1; the maximum is 5. The minimum decimal place is zero (0); the maximum decimal place is\nfour (4).\n3-20. The second part of this eight character (maximum length) amplifier shall be the speed or velocity unit\nof measure. Legal entries for this portion of the amplifier shall be \"KPH\" (kilometers per hour), \"MPS\"\n(meters per second), \"KTS\" (knots per hour), or \"MPH\" (miles per hour). Examples include\u2014\n\uf06c 220KPH = 220 kilometers per hour.\n\uf06c 974.5MPS = 974.5 meters per second.\n\uf06c 18.75KTS = 18.75 knots per hour.\n\uf06c 5MPH = 5 miles per hour.\n3-21. Direction of movement (field Q). The direction of movement amplifier is an arrow or staff identifying\nthe direction of movement or intended movement of an object. For land symbols, the amplifier is an angled\narrow extending downward from the bottom center of the frame or icon and pointing in the direction of\nmovement. For all other symbols, the amplifier is an arrow extending from the center of the frame or icon\nand pointing in the direction of movement (see figure 3-2).\n3-22.

The lettering for all military symbols will always be upper case. The lettering for all point, line, and\narea symbols will be oriented to the top of the display (north). In some cases the lettering may be tilted\nslightly to follow the contour of a line, but it must never be tilted so much that readers must tilt their heads\nto read it. The lettering for the bounding octagon will be the same as the orientation of the octagon. The\nlettering for the horizontal bounding octagon will be horizontal from left to right and the lettering for the\nvertical octagon will be vertical from top to bottom.\nTHE BUILDING PROCESS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-24. Chapters 4 through 7 provide an extensive number of icons and modifiers for building a wide variety\nof framed symbols. No attempt has been made to depict all possible combinations. Instead, a standard method\nfor constructing symbols is presented. Once the user is familiar with the prescribed system, any desired\nsymbol can be developed using the logical sequence provided in this chapter. The main icons shown in this\npublication are adequate for depicting all standard identities for framed symbols. When representing\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 3-9",
            "Chapter 3\nunorthodox framed symbols, users select the most appropriate main icon or modifier contained herein.\nSoldiers should avoid using any main icon or modifiers or combinations and modifications that differ from\nthose in this publication. If, after searching doctrinal icons and modifiers, it is necessary to create a new\nsymbol, users should explain the symbol in an accompanying legend. Computer-generated systems will have\ndifficulty in passing nonstandard symbols. Table 3-5 shows the steps in the building process for framed\nsymbols.\nTable 3-5. Building process for framed symbols\nStep Description Example\n1 Choose appropriate frame shape from table 3-1 on page 3-2.\n2 Choose appropriate main icon from chapters 2 through 5 and combine it\nwith frame.\n3 Choose appropriate sector 1 modifier from chapters 2 through 5.\n4 Choose appropriate sector 2 modifier from chapters 2 through 5.\n5 Choose minimum essential amplifiers from those listed in table 3-3 on\npage 3-4.\nUNFRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-25. Paragraphs 3-26 through 3-29 discuss unframed symbols. Control measure symbols and mission task\nverb symbols are unframed symbols. They conform to special rules for their own elements.\nCONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n3-26. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions. Control measures may be\nboundaries, special area designations, or other unique markings related to an operational environment\u2019s\ngeometry and be necessary for planning and managing operations. Control measure symbols represent control\nmeasures that can be graphically portrayed, and they provide operational information. They can be displayed\nas points, lines, and areas. Control measure symbols can be combined with other military symbols, main\nicons, and amplifiers to display operational information. Control measure symbols follow the same\nfundamental building rules as framed symbols, but they are built in accordance with their template. Control\nmeasure symbols can be black or white, depending on their display background. Display backgrounds can\nbe blue (for friendly), red (for hostile), green (for obstacles), or yellow (for a chemical, biological,\nradiological, and nuclear contaminated area fill). Description, placement, and further details of control\nmeasure symbols are addressed in chapter 8. Table 3-6 (on page 3-12) shows the steps in the building process\nfor control measure symbols. (See chapter 8 for more information about control measure symbols.)\n3-10 ADP 1-02 14 August 2018",
            "Military Symbology Fundamentals\nIcons for Control Measures\n3-27. The icon provides an abstract pictorial representation of the control measure. Icons can be depicted as\npoints, lines, or areas.\nModifiers for Control Measures\n3-28. Minefields and limited access areas have modifiers that can be used with the control measure. Limited\naccess areas use mobility sector 1 modifiers (see table 8-30 on page 8-115) and minefield control measures\nuse minefield sector 1 modifiers (see table 8-31 on pages 8-116 through 8-118). All other control measures\nuse amplifiers in the construct of the symbol.\nAmplifiers for Control Measures\n3-29. As with the framed symbols, the amplifier in a control measure provides additional information about\nthe icon being displayed. However, the location of the amplifiers for control measures varies and is dependent\non the control measure symbol being displayed. Because the location of amplifiers varies, there is no\nstandardized amplifier placement location for all types of control measures. Chapter 8 provides numerous\nfigures and tables that identify the location of amplifiers for each of the different types of control measures.\nFor multiple entries of the same type or similar information, the field number will be followed by a dash and\na number designating the second or more uses. For example, a from-to date-time group may use W for the\nstart time and W1 for the end time, or an airspace coordination area may use T to name an operational name\nor designation for the airspace coordination area and for the unique alphanumeric designation that identifies\nthe unit establishing the airspace control area. Arabic numerals are normally used when showing the unique\ndesignation of units. However, corps echelon units are identified with Roman numerals.\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 3-11",

Chapter 9 discusses mission and operational task symbols. The mission and operational task symbols\nare graphic representations of many of the tactical tasks, tactical enabling tasks, retrograde tasks, and special\npurpose attacks. However, not all have an associated symbol. Tactical task symbols are for use in course of\naction sketches, synchronization matrixes, and maneuver sketches. They do not replace any part of an\noperation order. Mission and operational task symbols should be scaled to fit the map scale and the size of\nunit represented.\n3-12 ADP 1-02 14 August 2018",

A unit is a military element whose structure is prescribed by a competent authority, such as a table of\norganization and equipment; specifically, part of an organization (JP 3-33). Icons in the main sector of the\nbounding octagon reflect the main function of the symbol. (See table 3-4 on pages 3-7 through 3-9.) Table\n4-1 (on pages 4-1 through 4-5) shows the main icons for units. There are exceptions to the main icon sector.\nThese exceptions are full frame icons. Full frame icons are not limited to the main sector of the bounding\noctagon. Full-frame icons may reflect the main function of the symbol, or they may reflect modifying\ninformation. Full frame modifiers will be found in the modifier 1 and 2 tables. Table 4-2 (on pages 4-6\nthrough 4-7) shows main icons for named units.\nTable 4-1.

Activities symbols are applicable across the range of military operations, but they normally focus on\nstability activities and defense support of civil authorities\u2019 activities. Activities can affect military operations.\nActivities represented by icons can include acts of terrorism, sabotage, organized crime, a disruption of the\nflow of vital resources, and the uncontrolled movement of large numbers of people. Many of these icons\nrepresent emergency first response activities used in the civilian community. Icons in the main sector reflect\nthe main function of the symbol. Table 7-1 (on pages 7-1 through 7-5) shows the main icons for activities.\nMany of the icons in this chapter are also found in individuals and organizations (see chapter 4) and\ninstallations (see chapter 6). The icons in table 4-11 (on pages 4-31 through 4-32) have been omitted from\ntable 7-1; however, all the icons in table 4-11 can be used to build activities icons.\nTable 7-1.

A control measure symbol is a graphic used on maps and displays to regulate forces and warfighting\nfunctions. Definitions of terms related to control measure symbols are provided in chapter 1. The control\nmeasure symbols in this chapter are organized by the six warfighting functions: mission command, movement\nand maneuver, fires, protection, sustainment, and intelligence. Also included are airspace control measures,\nwhich are a combination of movement and maneuver, fires, and protection. Control measure symbols\ngenerally fall into one of three categories: points, lines, or areas. The coloring and labeling of control measure\nsymbols are almost identical to framed symbols.\n8-2. The standard system in this chapter provides\u2014\n\uf06c A series of control measures symbols that follow standard formats and control measures symbols\nthat follow standalone formats.\n\uf06c Corresponding control measures symbol coloring.\n\uf06c Proper labeling of control measures symbols.\n\uf06c Corresponding definitions to help add clarity in using these symbols.\nCOMPOSITION OF CONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n8-3. Control measure symbols can be combined with other symbols, icons and amplifiers to display\noperational information (see figure 8-1). They do not follow the same building rules as the icon-based\nsymbols but shall be built in accordance with the draw rules specified in the symbol tables.\nControl Measure Components Completed Control Measure Symbol\n250300ZJUN18-\n250630ZJUN18\nIcon-based\nAdditional\nsymbol with\nControl measure information amplifier\namplifiers\nFigure 8-1. Composition of control measure symbols\nSTANDARD IDENTITY COLORING CONTROL MEASURES\n8-4. Friendly graphic control measures will be shown in black or blue when drawn manually or on a color\ncomputer-generated display. Hostile graphic control measures will be shown in red. If red is not available,\nthey will be drawn in black with the abbreviation \u201cENY\u201d placed on the graphic in at least two places.\nObstacles as shown in this chapter (friendly, hostile, neutral, unknown or factional) will be drawn using the\ncolor green. If the color green is not available, obstacles should be drawn using black. The color yellow will\nbe used for the hatching for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) contaminated areas.\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 8-1",
            "Chapter 8\nCONTROL MEASURE ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS\n8-5. Acronyms and abbreviations shown in this chapter are for use with Army control measure symbols,\nand no acronyms or abbreviations other than those provided in this publication may be used. Acronyms or\nabbreviations become part of the military symbol language when approved for use as military symbols and\nare no longer considered an acronym or abbreviation when used within the military symbol construct. The\nacronyms and abbreviations in this chapter are considered symbols that are part of the military symbol\nlexicon.\nLABELING CONTROL MEASURES\n8-6. Make all text labeling in upper case letters. The reader should be able to read the labels for all text\nlabels of modifier or amplifier fields for control measures symbols when the bottom of the overlay is closest\nto the reader. Labeling written on an angle should be readable to viewers so they do not have to turn their\nheads.\nSTATUS\n8-7. Status refers to whether a control measure exists at the location identified (status is \u201cpresent\u201d) or will\nin the future reside at that location (status is \u201cplanned\u201d, \u201canticipated\u201d, \u201csuspected\u201d, or \u201con order\u201d). If a control\nmeasure is on order, the status code shall be specified \u201cA \u2013 anticipated or planned\u201d and field amplifier \u201cW\u201d\nshall be present and specified \u201cO/O\u201d. In general, linear control measures (including boundary lines) and area\ncontrol measures shall be a solid line when indicating present status and a dashed line when indicating\nanticipated or planned status, as depicted in table 8-1. There are certain control measures such as\ncounterattack which are drawn in the \u201cpresent\u2019\u201d status with dashed lines.\nTable 8-1.

An amplifier provides optional additional information about a tactical symbol. The field identification,\nfield title, description, and maximum allowable display lengths of tactical symbol amplifiers are presented in\ntable 8-2 on pages 8-3 through 8-4. An example of each amplifier (both text and graphic indicators) is\nincluded in figure 8-2 on page 8-4. Amplifiers can be defined as either static or dynamic:\n\uf06c Static amplifiers are amplifiers whose size and placement are fixed and remain constant.\n\uf06c Dynamic amplifiers are amplifiers whose size and placement are based on the attributes of an\nobject and can change as these attributes and the scale of the background change.\n8-2 ADP 1-02 14 August 2018",

A task is a clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by individuals or organizations. A\ntactical mission task is a specific activity performed by a unit while executing a form of tactical operation or\nform of maneuver. A tactical mission task may be expressed as either an action by a friendly force or an\neffect on an enemy force (FM 3-90-1). The tactical mission tasks describe the results or effects the\ncommanders want to achieve.\nSYMBOLS FOR TACTICAL MISSION TASKS\n9-2. Table 9-1 on pages 9-2 through 9-3 shows the tactical mission tasks that have symbols. Not all tactical\nmission tasks have symbols. All of the tactical mission tasks shown in table 9-1 are defined in chapter 1.\nSome tactical mission task symbols will include unit symbols, and the tactical mission task \u201cdelay until a\nspecified time\u201d will use an amplifier. However, no modifiers are used with tactical mission task symbols.\nTactical mission task symbols are used in course of action sketches, synchronization matrices, and maneuver\nsketches. They do not replace any part of the operation order. Tactical mission task symbols are sized to\naccommodate the scale of the display or map being used. Where practical, the tactical mission task symbol\nconnects with the task organization composition symbol centered of the left or right side of the symbol or at\nthe center of the bottom of the symbol, depending on the orientation of the symbols.

Tactical\nenabling tasks support the conduct of operations and include reconnaissance, security, troop movement, relief\nin place, passage of lines, and encirclement operations.\n9-4. Reconnaissance operations include five forms\u2014route, zone, area, reconnaissance in force, and special\nreconnaissance. Examples of control measures for these forms of reconnaissance are provided in FM 3-90-2.\n9-5. Security operations encompass five tasks\u2014screen, guard, cover, area security, and local security.\nScreen, guard, and cover security tasks, respectively, contain increasing levels of combat power and provide\nincreasing levels of security for the main body.\n9-6. Relief in place operations are those in which, by direction of higher authority, all or part of a unit is\nreplaced in an area by the incoming unit and the responsibilities of the replaced elements for the mission and\nthe assigned zone of operations are transferred to the incoming unit. More specific control measures are\nprovided in FM 3-90-2.\n9-7. Passage of lines is an operation in which a force moves forward or rearward through another force's\ncombat positions with the intention of moving into or out of contact with the enemy. A passage may be\ndesignated as a forward or rearward passage of lines. More specific control measures are provided in\nFM 3-90-2.\n9-4 ADP 1-02 14 August 2018",

Retrograde tasks usually involve a combination of delay, withdrawal, and retirement operations.\nRetrograde is a defensive task that involves organized movement away from the enemy. The three forms of\nthe retrograde are delay, withdrawal, and retirement.\n9-10. Retrograde movement is any movement of a command to the rear, or away from the enemy. It may be\nforced by the enemy or may be made voluntarily. Such movements may be classified as withdrawal,\nretirement, or delaying actions.

A course of action is a scheme developed to accomplish a mission (JP 5-0). It constitutes a broad\npotential solution to an identified problem. Developing, comparing, analyzing, and deciding on a course of\naction is central to planning. The staff prepares a course of action statement and supporting sketch for each\ncourse of action under consideration. A course of action statement clearly describes how the unit will\naccomplish the mission. The course of action statement should be a brief expression of how the combined\narms concept will be conducted. The course of action sketch is the graphic portrayal of the course of action\nstatement. (See FM 6-0 for a detailed discussion of the military decisionmaking process, including course of\naction development.)\nMAKEUP OF COURSE OF ACTION SKETCH\n10-2. The course of action sketch provides a picture of the movement and maneuver aspects of the concept,\nincluding the positioning of forces. The course of action sketch becomes the basis for the operation overlay.\nAt a minimum, the course of action sketch includes the array of generic forces and control measures, such\nas\u2014\n\uf06c Unit and subordinate unit boundaries.\n\uf06c Unit movement formations (but not subordinate unit formations).\n\uf06c Line of departure, or line of contact and phase lines, if used.\n\uf06c Reconnaissance and security graphics.\n\uf06c Ground and air axes of advance.\n\uf06c Assembly areas, battle positions, strong points, engagement areas, and objectives.\n\uf06c Obstacle control measures and tactical mission graphics.\n\uf06c Fire support coordination and airspace control measures.\n\uf06c Main effort.\n\uf06c Location of command posts and critical information systems nodes.\n\uf06c Enemy locations, known or templated.\n\uf06c Population concentrations.\nMost symbols for use on the course of action sketch are shown in chapters 4 through 9. However, the unit\nsymbols do not provide decision makers with a quick and easy method of portraying detailed information\nrelating to task organization composition or combat effectiveness. Task organization composition symbols\nportray detailed information for course of action sketches.\nTASK ORGANIZATION COMPOSITION SYMBOLS\n10-3. Part of course of action development includes determining relative combat power and arraying forces\nto accomplish the primary tasks envisioned during action. After arraying forces, planners then group these\nforces underneath a generic headquarters representing the initial task organization. The initial task\norganization for each generic unit is portrayed in a task organization composition symbol.\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 10-1",
            "Chapter 10\n10-4. Task organization composition symbols are constructed using a rectangular frame, icons, and\namplifiers. Figure 10-1 depicts icon and amplifier fields. The icons and amplifiers have specific field\nplacement guidelines that follow current military symbol standards:\n\uf06c Field A is used to depict subordinate unit icons using the task organization icons in table 10-1.\nWhile there are four icons shown in table 10-1, there is no limitation as to the number of icons in\na row or number of rows. If needed, the first line of field A can be reserved to identify only those\nunits that have been attached (+), or detached (-), and for units that are one or more echelons lower\nthan the other designated units.\n\uf06c Field B is used to identify the echelon level of the headquarters. See chapter 4, paragraph 4-4 and\ntable 4-7 on page 4-26 for echelon amplifiers.\n\uf06c Field D denotes task force. See chapter 4, paragraph 4-5 and table 4-8 on page 4-27.\n\uf06c Field H is available for including a generic alphanumeric designation of the organization.\n\uf06c Field K is available for including the combat effectiveness using the icons in table 10-2 on page\n10-4.\nFigure 10-1. Task organization icon and amplifier fields\nTASK ORGANIZATION ICONS\n10-5. In all cases, task organization icons are the same as unit icons and amplifiers. Table 10-1 shows the\nmost commonly used icons and modifiers in their appropriate configurations.\n10-2 ADP 1-02 14 August 2018",

During course of action analysis and war gaming, the staff can track the combat effectiveness of units\nusing combat effectiveness icons in task organization composition symbols. Combat effectiveness refers to\nthe ability of a unit to perform its mission. Factors such as ammunition, personnel, status of fuel, and weapon\nsystems availability are assessed and rated. Commanders use this information to provide a net assessment of\nthe unit's ability to perform its mission. This assessment can then be expressed graphically using combat\neffectiveness icons. Table 10-2 (on page 10-4) shows two sets of combat effectiveness icons, which may be\nalso used with task organization composition symbols.\n10-7. Table 10-2 (on page 10-4) depicts combat effectiveness icons for the overall combat rating of the unit\nin the center column. Table 10-2 specifies combat effectiveness icons for the status of selected items of\ninterest in the right column. The four selected items shown in the right column are ammunition; weapons;\npetroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL); and personnel. Standard operating procedures will specify the items\nof interest to be reported. Commanders may add to this list for internal reporting and tracking.\n14 August 2018 ADP 1-02 10-3",

            "Introduction\nADP 6-22 establishes and describes what leaders should be and do. Having a standard set of leader attributes\nand core leader competencies facilitates focused feedback, education, training, and development across all\nleadership levels. ADP 6-22 describes enduring concepts of leadership through the core competencies and\nattributes required of leaders of all cohorts and all organizations, regardless of mission or setting. These\nprinciples reflect decades of experience and validated scientific knowledge.\nAn ideal Army leader serves as a role model through strong intellect, physical presence, professional\ncompetence, and moral character. An Army leader is able and willing to act decisively, within superior\nleaders\u2019 intent and purpose, and in the organization\u2019s best interests. Army leaders recognize that\norganizations, built on mutual trust and confidence, accomplish missions.\nEvery member of the Army, military or civilian, is part of a team and functions in the role of leader and\nsubordinate. Being a good subordinate is part of being an effective leader. Leaders do not just lead\nsubordinates\u2014they also lead other leaders. Leaders are not limited to just those designated by position, rank,\nor authority.\nBeing and doing are ineffectual without knowledge. Knowing the what and how of soldiering, tactics,\noperational art, staff operations, functional and technical expertise, and many other areas are essential to\nleading well.

            "Chapter 1\nThe Army\nFor more than 240 years, the United States Army has protected the people and interests\nof the Nation. The Army is not alone. The Marines Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast\nGuard, government agencies, and local law enforcement and firefighters all perform\nsimilar services to the Nation and its communities. All volunteered. In many cases,\nthey choose to place themselves in harm\u2019s way based on a conviction that personal\nservice makes a difference. Leading Soldiers, though, requires a deeper understanding\nof what frames this profession and that all Soldiers come from different backgrounds\nand all possess distinct world-views. To inspire Soldiers to risk their lives requires\nprofessional leaders capable of providing purpose, direction, and motivation. This\nchapter describes the Army Profession and introduces Army leadership.\n\u2026the Soldier, above all other people, prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the\ndeepest wounds and scars of war.\nGeneral of the Army Douglas MacArthur\nThayer Award acceptance speech, 1962\nA SHARED LEGACY\n1-1. War is a lethal clash of wills and an inherently human endeavor that requires perseverance, sacrifice,\nand tenacity. The United States Army\u2019s primary reason for existence is to conduct large-scale combat\noperations for as long as is required to prevail as part of the joint force. Army leaders provide purpose,\ndirection, and motivation required to endure the physical hardship, privation, and danger of combat. Army\nleaders inspire others to risk their lives to accomplish missions of importance to the Nation. All the other\ncontexts where leaders exercise leadership daily ensure the Army is prepared to do what the Nation requires.\n1-2. Army leaders have served honorably since the beginning of the Nation. Americans fought the\nRevolutionary War to achieve an idea, that a group of different people could find common ground and\ndemocratically govern themselves free from monarchs. Only a poet could summarize the meaning and\nenormity of this idea, the war, and its impact on the planet since then.\nHere once the embattled farmers stood and fired the shot heard round the world.\nRalph Waldo Emerson\nConcord Hymn\n1-3. On 14 June 1775, the Continental Congress created the Continental Army and gave it the mission to\nfight Great Britain and help create what would become the United States of America. Those who believed in\na greater purpose and were willing to sacrifice for it made up this all-volunteer army, like today.\n1-4. Following the Revolutionary War, the Nation had to resolve many new challenges. The Articles of the\nConfederation did not adequately allow for a central governing body, provide the capability to raise funds to\npay debt, or maintain a navy or army for defense. The colonies resolved to draft a constitution and provide a\nframework for a new form of government. In 1787, delegates from the colonies met in Philadelphia and\ndrafted a constitution. For two years, the colonies debated; in 1789, they signed the Constitution of the United\nStates, forming the United States. In 1796, the Army officially became known as the United States Army.\n1-5. Since 1796, the Army has changed many times. For most of its history, it was a small regular force\naugmented by militias and volunteers during times of crisis. It rapidly expanded to enormous size for a civil\nand two world wars, and then contracted again after the wars were won. The Army integrated in 1948. In\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 1-1",
            "Chapter 1\n1973, the Nation determined that an all-volunteer professional force was a better idea than a conscripted\n(drafted) army. In 2016, all military occupation specialties opened to women and men alike. The United\nStates Army is likely to evolve again in the future, even as the purpose for its existence remains unchanged.\n1-6. The Army of today carries the streamers of dozens of battles whose outcomes, in some cases, decided\nthe fate of this Nation and other countries. The Army\u2019s motto of \u201cThis we\u2019ll defend\u201d summarizes the Army\u2019s\nlegacy of responsibility.\nTHE ARMY PROFESSION\n1-7. The Army Profession is a vocation of Soldiers and Department of the Army Civilians whose collective\nexpertise is the ethical design of, support to, and application of landpower; serving under civilian authority;\nand entrusted to defend the Constitution and the rights and interests of the American people. The Army\nProfession is unique because of its responsibilities related to the ethical application of violence on a large\nscale on behalf of the Nation. The Army Values guide the Army Profession.\n1-8. Professions share essential characteristics. Professions\u2014\n\uf06c Are a full-time occupation.\n\uf06c Possess training or education programs relative to the field.\n\uf06c Have a distinct body of knowledge.\n\uf06c Operate within established ethics.\n\uf06c Are self-policing.\n1-9. Because of these generally accepted characteristics, society trusts professionals who possess the\ncharacter, commitment, and competence to be trusted. This trust grants professions the autonomy and\ndiscretion with prudent, balanced oversight or external controls. If a profession violates its ethic and loses\nthe trust of society, then it becomes subject to increased societal regulation and governance.\n1-10. The Army Values incorporate the historical Army Ethic: loyalty, integrity, duty, and selfless-service.\nThey encompass the enduring moral principles, beliefs, and laws that shape the Army culture of trust and\nguide Army professionals in accomplishing the mission as well as their conduct in all aspects of life. The\nArmy Ethic embodied within the Army Values has its origins in the philosophical heritage, theological and\ncultural traditions, and the historical legacy that frame our Nation. Army professionals take an oath to support\nand defend the Constitution, an obligation that includes adherence to United States Code, the Uniformed\nCode of Military Justice, and all applicable orders and directives. This includes respecting life and liberty as\nself-evident, universal rights.\n1-11. The Army Values are\u2014\n\uf06c Loyalty: bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, the Army, your\nunit and other Soldiers.\n\uf06c Duty: fulfill your obligations.\n\uf06c Respect: treat people as they should be treated.\n\uf06c Selfless service: put the welfare of the nation, the Army, and your subordinates before your own.\n\uf06c Honor: live up to the Army Values.\n\uf06c Integrity: do what is right, legally and morally.\n\uf06c Personal courage: face fear, danger, or adversity.\n1-12. All members aspire to achieve the Army Values professionally and personally. The Army Values are\na compass needle, always pointing toward what the Nation demands of its Army. Often, the Army is the face\nof the Nation abroad. During conflict, the Army employs lethal violence in accordance with the law of armed\nconflict and rules of engagement under the most demanding conditions. This is an enormous responsibility\nand the people of the United States require the Army to adhere to its values and represent its interests across\nthe range of military operations and the competition continuum. See chapter 2 for a detailed discussion of the\nArmy Values.\n1-13. The Constitution of the United States best illustrates the impacts of an army losing the trust of its\npeople. In the 18th century, nations used standing armies to subjugate people at the whim of the monarch. In\n1-2 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "The Army\nmany ways, an army was the face of tyranny. Within the Constitution, there are certain controls that arose\nfrom the natural fear at the time of a standing army. Amendments in the Bill of Rights directly address\npractices of standing armies that citizens feared, such as unreasonable searches and seizures and the\nquartering of soldiers in private homes. While these may seem dated and irrelevant today, they are not. They\nare steadfast reminders that the Army serves the people of the United States. The oaths taken by enlisted and\ncommissioned Soldiers and DA Civilians amplify these points.\nArmy Oaths\nOath of Enlistment\nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the\nUnited States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and\nallegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United\nStates and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and\nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.\nOath of Office for commissioned officers and DA Civilians\nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the\nUnited States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and\nallegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation\nor purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office\non which I am about to enter. So help me God.\nARMY LEADERSHIP\n1-14. The Army experience over more than two centuries is that most people have leadership potential and\ncan learn to be effective leaders. The ability to influence others is a central component of leadership. As a\nresult, leader development has long been an Army priority (see FM 6-22 for more information regarding\nleader development). This development begins with education, training, and experience, and requires\nunderstanding about what Army leaders do and why\n1-15. Leadership is the activity of influencing people by providing purpose, direction, and motivation\nto accomplish the mission and improve the organization. Leadership as an element of combat power,\ncoupled with information, unifies the warfighting functions (movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires,\nsustainment, protection and command and control). Leadership focuses and synchronizes organizations.\nLeaders inspire people to become energized and motivated to achieve desired outcomes. An Army leader is\nanyone who by virtue of assumed role or assigned responsibility inspires and influences people by\nproviding purpose, direction, and motivation to accomplish the mission and improve the organization.\nINFLUENCING\n1-16. Influencing is persuading people do what is necessary. Influencing entails more than simply passing\nalong orders. Through words and personal example, leaders inspire purpose, provide direction, and when\nrequired motivation.\nPURPOSE\n1-17. Leaders provide clear purpose for their subordinates. Purpose gives subordinates a reason to achieve a\ndesired outcome. Leaders convey purpose through direct means such as requests, directives, or orders.\nLeaders inspire subordinates to do their best by instilling a higher purpose that rises above self-interest. They\nexplain why something should or must be done and provide context whenever possible. Subordinates who\nunderstand why they are doing something difficult and discern the higher purpose are more likely to do the\nright thing when leaders are not present to direct their every action.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 1-3",
            "Chapter 1\nDIRECTION\n1-18. Direction is telling others what to do. Providing effective direction requires that leaders communicate\nthe desired end state for the direction they provide. To accomplish a mission, leaders prioritize tasks, assign\nresponsibility, supervise, and ensure subordinates perform to standard. They ensure subordinates clearly\nunderstand their guidance, while allowing subordinates the opportunity to demonstrate initiative within the\noverall commander's intent. Providing clear direction allows subordinate initiative to adapt their tasks within\nthe commander\u2019s intent when circumstances change.\n1-19. The Army requires leaders who provide direction and subordinates who can execute without the need\nfor continuous guidance. The Army needs leaders who understand, train, and employ mission command\nduring the course of their duties. Mission command is the Army\u2019s approach to command and control that\nempowers subordinate decision making and decentralized execution appropriate to the situation (ADP 6-0).\nMission command recognizes that no single person in an organization or unit can make every important\ndecision at every critical moment, nor can a single person keep up with the number of simultaneous decisions\norganizations require during combat or other time-constrained environments. See ADP 6-0 for further\ndiscussion about mission command.\nMOTIVATION\n1-20. Motivation is the will and initiative to do what is necessary to accomplish a mission. While motivation\ncomes from within, others\u2019 actions and words affect it. A leader\u2019s role in motivation is at times to understand\nothers\u2019 needs and desires, to align and elevate individual desires into team goals, and to inspire others to\naccomplish those larger goals, even if it means risking their lives. At other times, such as time constrained or\ndangerous situations, the leader gets subordinates to do things quickly and explain the reasons why later.\n1-21. Indirect approaches to motivation can be as successful as direct approaches. Setting a personal example\ncan sustain the drive in others. This becomes apparent when leaders share hardship and risk with\nsubordinates. Leaders who personally share hardship and risk demonstrate to subordinates that they are\ninvested in the outcome and willing and able to do what they ask subordinates to do. Indirect approaches\nsuch as these build confidence about the judgment, commitment, and attitude of the leader.\n1-22. How leaders motivate others matters. There are practices that are always positive, while others are\ngood or bad depending on the context of the situation. There are those who can inspire others to act because\nthey respect the leader\u2019s judgment, respect that the leader earned. Earning this type of personal respect takes\ntime, so leaders may need to motivate others initially based upon the authorities and respect inherent in their\nduty position. In either case, leaders should be judicious about using pressure or threat of punishment when\nmotivating others, because doing so too often or when unnecessary breeds resentment and low morale.\nAspiring leaders observe many different methods others use to motivate subordinates, and should remember\nand practice those that were most effective while avoiding those that negatively affected an organization.\n1-4 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "The Army\nColonel Robert B. Nett\nNear Cognon, Leyte, Philippine Islands\u201414 December 1944\nThen-Lieutenant Nett commanded Company E, 305th Infantry during an attack against\na reinforced enemy battalion, which had held up the American advance for two days\nfrom entrenched positions. With another infantry company and armored vehicles,\nCompany E advanced against heavy machinegun and small arms fire with LT Nett\nspearheading the assault. During fierce hand-to-hand encounters, he killed seven\nJapanese and, although seriously wounded, led his men forward, refusing to relinquish\ncommand. He was severely wounded again, but, unwilling to retire, pressed ahead\nwith his troops to assure capture of the objective. Wounded again in the final assault,\nhe arranged for the resumption of the advance before turning over his command, then\nwalked unaided to the rear for medical treatment. LT Nett\u2019s remarkable courage in\ncontinuing to lead through sheer determination despite successive wounds, LT Nett\nprovided an inspiring example for his company and was instrumental in the capture of\na vital strongpoint. For this action, he received the Medal of Honor.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 1-5",
            "Chapter 1\nARMY LEADERSHIP REQUIREMENTS MODEL\n1-23. The leadership requirements model is grounded in historical experience and determinations of what\nworks best for the Army. Army research supports the model\u2019s completeness and validity. The model\nidentifies core competencies and attributes applicable to all types and echelons of Army organizations. The\nmodel conveys expectations and establishes the capabilities needed of all Army leaders regardless of rank,\ngrade, uniform, or attire. Collectively, the leadership requirements model is a significant contributor to\nindividual and unit readiness and effectiveness.\n1-24. As a common leadership model for the Army, the leadership requirements model aligns expectations\nwith leader development activities and personnel management practices and systems. Understanding the\nexpectations and applying the attributes and competencies prepares leaders for the situations they are most\nlikely to encounter. The model informs leaders of the enduring capabilities needed regardless of echelon,\nmission, or assignment. All model components are interrelated and relate to the Department of Defense\n(DOD) civilian leader development framework found in DODI 1430.16.\n1-25. The model\u2019s components center on what a leader is (attributes\u2014BE and KNOW) and what a leader\ndoes (competencies\u2014DO). A leader\u2019s character, presence, and intellect enable them to apply the core leader\ncompetencies and enhance their proficiency. Leaders who gain expertise through operational assignments,\ninstitutional learning, and self-development will be versatile enough to adapt to most situations and grow into\ngreater responsibilities. Figure 1-1 illustrates the framework.\n1-26. A major distinction between the attributes and competencies of the leadership requirements model is\nthat competencies are skills that can be trained and developed while attributes encompass enduring personal\ncharacteristics, which are molded through experience over time. A Soldier can be trained to be an effective\nmachine gunner, but may not necessarily be a brave machine gunner without additional experience. Every\neducational, operational, and self-development event is an opportunity for observation, feedback, and\nreflection.\nFigure 1-1. The Army leadership requirements model\n1-6 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "The Army\nCORE LEADER ATTRIBUTES\n1-27. Attributes are characteristics internal to a leader. These affect how an individual behaves, thinks, and\nlearns within certain conditions. Strong character, solid presence, and keen intellect enable individuals to\nperform the core leader competencies with greater effect. The three categories of core attributes are\u2014\n\uf06c Character: the moral and ethical qualities of the leader.\n\uf06c Presence: characteristics open to display by the leader and open to viewing by others.\n\uf06c Intellect: the mental and social abilities the leader applies while leading.\nCORE LEADER COMPETENCIES\n1-28. The core leader competencies are actions that the Army expects leaders to do: lead, develop, and\nachieve. Competencies provide an enduring, clear, and consistent way of conveying expectations for Army\nleaders. The core competencies are universal for all Army leaders. The core competency categories are\u2014\n\uf06c Leads: provides purpose, direction, and motivation; builds trust; provides an example;\ncommunicates.\n\uf06c Develops: develops themselves, creates a positive climate, develops subordinates, and stewards\nthe profession.\n\uf06c Achieves: executes, adjusts, and gets results to accomplish tasks and missions on time and to\nstandard.\n1-29. The core leader competencies make up a core set. Figure 1-2 depicts similarities and distinctions among\ncore leader competencies, demonstrates how competencies fall into three categories and that each represents\ndifferent leader actions. For instance, Army leaders are expected to develop themselves (prepares self),\ndevelop others, ensure unit readiness (create a positive environment) and sustain the Army as a whole\n(stewards the profession).\nFigure 1-2. Navigating leader competencies\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 1-7",
            "Chapter 1\nDYNAMICS OF LEADERSHIP\n1-30. The most effective leaders adapt their approach to the mission, the organization, and the situation. A\ndivision commander addressing brigade commanders before conducting large-scale combat operations leads\nand communicates differently than a drill sergeant training new recruits in basic training. Constant change\naffects peacetime and combat operations. Personnel change out. Timelines move. Anticipated resources do\nnot materialize. Adversaries do what was least expected. Weather keeps CAS assets grounded. Commanders,\nleaders, and staffs plan for possible changes and continually monitor progress to engage as needed. Leaders\naccount for the important factors affecting the dynamics of leadership. Three consistent factors are\u2014\n\uf06c The leader.\n\uf06c The led.\n\uf06c The situation.\nTHE LEADER\n1-31. An Army leader influences others to accomplish missions. A leader has the opportunity to lead when\nassigned responsibility, assuming a role, or being an informal leader within a team. Leaders motivate people\nboth inside and outside the chain of command toward action or to change their thinking when appropriate.\nFormally or informally, regardless of position or rank, all Army members can find themselves in situations\nto lead and influence others. Leaders who adapt their actions based on the dynamics of a situation achieve\nthe best possible outcomes. Leaders take into account the level of their experience or skill, and their authority.\n1-32. Everyone has an identity or a way they see themselves. Leaders internalize the roles, responsibilities,\nand actions that they understand of a leader to be, know, and do. Leaders who are unsure of themselves filling\nthe role of a leader will be limited until they have confidence. Without a clear leader identity, others will\nquestion the type of leader they are, what they stand for, and the way they conduct themselves. What a leader\nbelieves about their role as a leader serves as a constant guide to behave as a leader of good character. Practice\nidentifying as a leader\u2014doing the right things in the right way\u2014becomes habitual and helps junior personnel\nalong the path to becoming seasoned, effective leaders.\n1-33. Self-awareness is fundamental to understanding one\u2019s abilities. Leaders should know their strengths\nand weaknesses: what they do or do not know, what they are or are not skilled at, and what is in their span of\ncontrol. Even though they should be self-aware, not all leaders are. Leaders vary in their proficiency levels\nin attributes and competencies and their preparation for each situation. Leaders require self-awareness if they\nare to accurately assess their own experience and competence as well as earn the trust of those they influence.\nBeing self-aware means seeing one\u2019s self as viewed by others and understanding the levels of influence one\nis likely to have with followers. For instance, a newly assigned company commander understands that\nparticipating with Soldiers on a 12-mile ruck-march builds subordinates\u2019 respect for the leader and builds the\nleader\u2019s credibility with them. Awareness allows one to adjust one's leadership actions in the moment and\nknow what areas to improve for the future.\n1-34. Leaders have different responsibilities and authorities that can vary with duty positions and missions.\nAuthority to lead is either formally derived from rank or position or is informal, such as when influencing\npeers or coalition partners. Formal authority allows use of commitment and compliance through the methods\nof influence (see chapter 5). Informal authority primarily relies on obtaining commitment from others.\nFormal Leadership\n1-35. Formal leadership authority is granted to individuals by virtue of assignment to positions of\nresponsibility, according to their rank and experience. The Uniform Code of Military Justice supports military\nleaders in positions of legitimate authority. Formal leaders exercise their authority over subordinates through\nlawful orders and directives. An Army leader operates with clear expectations regarding conduct so that\nindiscipline does not jeopardize mission success. Leaders, through formally assigned authorities and clearly\ncommunicated standards, are responsible for ensuring adherence to standards, policies, and codes. Team\nleaders, squad leaders, platoon leaders, staff officers, commanders, and civilian supervisors are all examples\nof leaders in positions with formal designations of authority.\n1-8 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "The Army\n1-36. Command is the authority that a commander in the armed forces lawfully exercises over subordinates\nby virtue of rank or assignment (JP 1). Command includes the authority and responsibility for effectively\nusing available resources and for planning the employment of, organizing, directing, coordinating, and\ncontrolling military forces for the accomplishment of assigned missions. Command also includes\nresponsibility for health, welfare, morale, and discipline of assigned personnel.\n1-37. In Army organizations, commanders establish standards and policies for achieving and rewarding\nexemplary performance, as well as for punishing misconduct. Military commanders enforce lawful orders\nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Consequently, commanders' personalities profoundly affect\norganizations. The Army expects leaders selected for command to lead beyond mere exercise of formal\nauthority. They lead by example and serve as role models. Their personal example and actions carry\ntremendous weight.\n1-38. Command is personal. In Army regulations and doctrine, an individual, not an institution or group, is\ngiven the authority to command. The legal and ethical responsibilities of a commander exceed those of any\nother leader of similar rank serving in a staff position or as a civilian manager. The relationships among\ncommanders and subordinate officers, noncommissioned officers, enlisted Soldiers, and DA Civilians is\ndistinct. Those not in command must understand that the commander alone is responsible for what their\ncommand does or fails to do. Subordinates have the responsibility to support the commander\u2019s intent for their\ncommand, unit, or organization.\nInformal Leadership\n1-39. Informal leadership exists throughout organizations and plays an important role in mission\naccomplishment. Informal leadership is not exercised based on rank or position in the organization. It stems\nfrom personal initiative, special knowledge, unique experiences, or technical expertise specific to an\nindividual or team. Informal leadership occurs when someone takes the initiative to assume responsibility for\naction in a situation, takes charge when no formal leader is present, or to make formal leaders aware of\nsomething they need to know. Informal leaders contribute to team success.\n1-40. Informal networks arise both inside and outside organizations. These informal networks include the\nnoncommissioned officer (NCO) support channel. To build cohesive teams, leaders interact with both formal\nand informal teams, including the traditional chain of command and technical channels combining\ncommanders and staff officers. The collaboration of first sergeants within a battalion is also an example of\nan informal network. Informal networks that operate in support of organizational goals are a force multiplier.\nConversely, informal networks that operate at cross-purposes to the chain of command are destructive to an\norganization and intolerable.\nTHE LED\n1-41. The led are an important factor in leadership. Leaders, who consider their strengths along with\nsubordinates\u2019 capabilities and the situational demands of missions, create the best chance at accomplishing\ntasks and missions. Inexperienced subordinates and those with limited competence require greater oversight\nand control. Seasoned, competent subordinates require less oversight and control.\n1-42. Experience, competence, and commitment of those led vary with the mission and situation. For\nexample, people with significant combat experience may be overly capable to perform a mission, but their\ncommitment may lag if they do not consider the mission worth risking life or limb. Commitment varies with\ntrust in the leader directing the mission. Trust between the leader and the led can vary across situations. A\nleader applies greater control over some subordinates than others. Generally, when subordinates have greater\nlevels of expertise and commitment, leaders trust and empower them.\n1-43. Every Army leader is a subordinate to someone, so all leaders are also followers. Each Soldier and DA\nCivilian begins service by swearing an oath of service that subordinates him or her to the Nation\u2019s civilian\nleadership (see page 1-3). This obligation remains throughout a career regardless of position or rank attained.\nEffective Army organizations depend on the willingness of their leaders and their subordinates to serve\nfaithfully and competently in both leadership and followership roles.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 1-9",
            "Chapter 1\n1-44. Followers respond to the authority of a leader and specific direction. Following is more than just doing\nwhat one is told to do. Motivation is an aspect of following. Effective followership requires an ability to take\nthe initiative to get things done when necessary. Effective leaders learn to be trusted followers. Teaching\nweapons maintenance provides an example. New Soldiers clean their rifles how and when instructed to do\nso. Experienced Soldiers routinely clean their weapon without being told so that it will function when needed.\nThis simple discipline of doing the right thing when no one is looking is fundamental to following.\n1-45. There is a tendency to think of people as either a leader or subordinate, but leading and following are\nsimultaneous responsibilities. This is particularly true in a hierarchical organization like the Army. Everyone\ncharged with leading others has a responsibility to follow their superior in the chain of command. Being an\neffective follower requires the same attributes and competencies required to be an effective leader, although\napplication is different. When following, Army leaders respond to their superiors\u2019 authority and guidance.\nThe principles of mission command capture this: leaders empower followers, by fostering mutual trust and\ncreating shared understanding, to take initiative based on the commander\u2019s intent. The subordinate leader\ntransitions from follower to leader as they take action and direct their followers.\nTHE SITUATION\n1-46. The situation affects which actions leaders take. Leaders consider the unique characteristics of the task\nor mission at hand, the abilities of their subordinates, their familiarity with similar situations, and amount of\ntime available. High-risk or urgent situations often require immediate and decisive actions, particularly in\ncombat. Low-risk or slowly developing situations allow leaders to spend more time with deliberate and\ncollaborative approaches, coaching, and teaching subordinates as they go along. This fosters a higher level\nof commitment, develops subordinates, and creates the organizational cohesion essential for leading\nsuccessfully in challenging situations.\n1-47. Leaders learn to adapt to the situation by disciplining themselves to practice different approaches. This\nprepares leaders to adapt to new, urgent, stressful, or high-risk situations. In general, leaders should strive to\nimprove all of the leader attributes and core leadership competencies, adapt their leadership techniques to\neach situation, and become lifelong learners. This requires leaders to\u2014\n\uf06c Know how to assess tasks and conditions.\n\uf06c Know how to assess their own capabilities and those of their followers.\n\uf06c Know how to adjust their leadership techniques.\n\uf06c Know those they lead.\n\uf06c Understand how to employ the mission command approach to the situation.\n\uf06c Develop themselves and the competence of subordinates.\n\uf06c Establish and maintain positive leadership climates.\nThe Reluctant Machine Gunner\nIraq in 2003 was the first combat experience for many. SSG Jones was new to combat,\nas were all members of the squad. They had not seen any action until they arrived in\nRamadi. While clearing a section of buildings, they came under fire. SSG Jones\ndirected his M249 machine gunners to suppress an enemy position in an adjacent\nbuilding. One gunner did not engage. SSG Jones again directed his machine gunner\nto engage; he did not. SSG Jones calmly moved to the gunner\u2019s position, took the\nmachine gun, and fired a burst. SSG Jones handed the weapon to the machine gunner\nand said, \u201cSuppress that position.\u201d The gunner did and did not hesitate again.\nHere the squad leader instinctively knew what it would take to get the subordinate to\nact. Because the squad leader understood the gunner the squad leader did not have\nto threaten, belittle, or remove him from combat. The squad leader just had to show\nthat what needed to be done, could be done.\n1-10 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "The Army\nROLES OF LEADERSHIP\n1-48. Every individual in the Army is a member of a team, as a leader or a follower. Each leadership role\nand responsibility is unique, yet leaders interact in common ways. The Army is comprised of Soldiers and\nDA Civilians. Soldiers are officers, NCOs, and enlisted. The Department of the Army employs DA Civilians\nand, like Soldiers, are members of the executive branch of the federal government. The Army charges all\nmembers to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. They all take\noaths to the Constitution that commit them to follow the laws of the Nation and orders of those appointed\nover them. Army professionals who embrace and live the Army Values are role models and standard-bearers\nfor the organization. Army leaders come from three different categories\u2014\n\uf06c Officers.\n\uf06c Noncommissioned officers.\n\uf06c DA Civilians.\nOFFICERS\n1-49. Officers command units, establish policy, and manage resources while balancing risks and caring for\ntheir people and families. They integrate collective, leader, and Soldier training to accomplish the Army's\nmissions. They serve at all levels, from leading tactical unit operations to leading change at strategic levels.\nCommand makes officers responsible and accountable for everything their command does or fails to do.\n1-50. The technical characteristic that distinguishes officers (including warrant officers) the most is that they\nhold their grade and office under a commission or appointment issued by the authority of the President of the\nUnited States or the Secretary of the Army. They receive commissions based upon the basis of special trust\nand confidence placed in the officer's patriotism, valor, fidelity, and abilities. An officer's commission grants\nauthority to direct subordinates and subsequently, an obligation to obey superiors.\n1-51. Serving as an officer differs from other forms of Army leadership by the measure of responsibility\nattached, and in the magnitude of the consequences of inaction or ineffectiveness. An enlisted leader swears\nan oath of obedience to lawful orders, while an officer promises to, \"well and faithfully discharge the duties\nof the office\u201d (see page 1-2). Officers maintain the momentum of operations. While officers depend on the\ncounsel, technical skill, maturity, and experience of subordinates to translate their orders into action, they are\nultimately responsible for mission success.\n1-52. Warrant officers possess a high degree of specialization in a particular field in contrast to the more\ngeneral assignment pattern of other officers. Warrant officers may command aircraft, maritime vessels, and\nspecial units. Warrant officers provide expert tactical and technical advice, knowledge, counsel, and solutions\nto support their unit or organization. They maintain, administer, and manage the Army's equipment, support\nactivities, and technical systems. Their extensive professional experience and technical knowledge qualifies\nwarrant officers as invaluable role models and mentors for officers and NCOs.\n1-53. While warrant officer positions are usually functionally oriented, warrant officers may lead and direct\nSoldiers. Senior warrant officers provide the commander with the benefit of years of tactical and technical\nexperience. Warrant officers functioning at senior levels become systems experts rather than equipment\nexperts. They must understand the conditions and know how to integrate the systems they manage into\ncomplex operational environments.\nNONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS\n1-54. Noncommissioned officers are the backbone of the Army and are responsible for maintaining Army\nstandards and discipline. NCOs are critical to training, educating, and developing individuals, crews, and\nsmall teams. NCOs are accountable for the care of their Soldiers and setting examples for them.\n1-55. The Army relies on NCOs capable of conducting daily operations, executing small unit tactical\noperations, and making commander\u2019s intent-driven decisions. Subordinates look to NCOs for solutions,\nguidance, and inspiration. Soldiers count on NCOs they trust and admire. They expect them to convey\ninformation and provide day-to-day guidance to accomplish tactical and technical tasks. All Soldiers look to\nNCOs to train them to cope, prepare, and perform courageously regardless of the situation.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 1-11",
            "Chapter 1\n1-56. While preparing Soldiers for missions, NCOs stress fieldcraft and physical and mental rigor. NCOs\nunderstand that improved warfighting technology will not reduce the need for mentally and physically fit\nSoldiers. Soldiers will continue to carry heavy loads, and engage enemy forces in close combat. Tactical\nsuccess relates directly to the Soldiers' level of tactical and technical training, as well as their fitness and\nresiliency. Soldier care includes preparing them for future challenges and adversity. ATP 6-22.5 contains\nmaterial related to Soldier care.\n1-57. NCOs are trainers, mentors, communicators, and advisors. NCOs advise and assist in the development\nof officers by sharing their experience and professional judgment. They form professional and personal bonds\nwith officers based on mutual trust and common goals. Commanders at all levels have senior enlisted advisors\nwho provide advice and serve as an important source of knowledge about enlisted matters, as well as experts\nabout tactical and technical questions. At the highest level, the Sergeant Major of the Army is the Army Chief\nof Staff's personal advisor who recommends policy to support Soldiers throughout the Army.\nFirst Sergeant Conrad Schmidt\nWinchester, Virginia\u201419 September 1864\nThe 2d Cavalry Regiment was reeling from tremendous losses during the Battle of\nWinchester, Virginia when the regimental commander, Captain Theodore\nRhodenbough, had his horse shot from under him within a few yards of the\nConfederate entrenchments. Then-Orderly Sergeant Conrad Schmidt recognized the\ndanger the regimental commander was in, disregarded his own safety, and rode to the\ncommander\u2019s assistance. Schmidt dragged Rhodenbough up on the rear of his horse,\nbrought him to safety under an extreme volley of gunfire, and returned Rhodenbough\nto command of the regiment. Schmidt\u2019s actions earned him the Medal of Honor.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY CIVILIANS\n1-58. Department of the Army Civilians are professionals committed to serving the Nation as an integral part\nof the Army team. They provide mission-essential capability, stability, and continuity to support Soldiers.\nDA Civilians are committed to honorable service in the performance of their duties. The Army Civilian Corps\nCreed affirms their role as members of the Army team and their special contribution to organizational stability\nand continuity. Major roles and responsibilities of DA Civilians include\u2014\n\uf06c Establishing and executing policy.\n\uf06c Leading Army organizations and managing programs, projects, and systems.\n\uf06c Operating activities and facilities for Army equipment, support, research, and technical work\nsupporting the Army around the world.\n1-59. Selection of DA Civilians to a government position depends on their eligibility based on their\ncredentials and expertise. Proficiency derives from previous education and training, prior experiences, and\nties to career programs. DA Civilians hold the grade of the position in which they serve and primarily exercise\nauthority based on the position held, not their grade. DA Civilians do not exercise military command,\nhowever when designated they may exercise general supervision over an Army installation or activity under\nthe command of a military superior.\n1-60. Civilian personnel have functional proponents for career fields that ensure provisions exist for career\ngrowth and are free to pursue positions and promotions as desired. Personnel policies generally state that DA\nCivilians should be in positions that do not require military personnel for reasons of law, training, security,\ndiscipline, rotation, or combat readiness. DA Civilians, many with uniformed military experience, bring a\nwealth of knowledge and experience to the Army team.\n1-61. While most DA Civilians historically support military forces at home stations, they also deploy with\nmilitary forces to provide expertise and support. DA Civilians often remain for long periods within the same\norganization, providing continuity and stability that the dynamic personnel management system used for the\nmilitary rarely allows.\n1-12 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "The Army\nLEVELS OF LEADERSHIP\n1-62. The Army acknowledges three levels of leadership\u2014\n\uf06c Direct.\n\uf06c Organizational.\n\uf06c Strategic.\n1-63. The leader attributes and competencies apply across all leadership levels. The concept of subordination\nhelps members understand the expectations the Army has for them across a career. Foundations include\nunderstanding oaths, dignity and respect for all people, the Army Values, leadership, command, authority,\nArmy operations, military discipline, and similar basics (see figure 1-3). Leaders gain a firmer understanding\nof the enduring requirements and add specialized knowledge as they move through the levels.\nFigure 1-3. Army leadership levels.\n1-64. Factors determining a leadership level include the leader\u2019s relationship to a subordinate, number of\nsubordinates, scope of responsibility, and time horizons of missions. Regardless of which level they serve in,\na leader is always a direct leader. Direct leaders are task oriented. Organizational leaders are both task and\nmission oriented and lead through subordinate leaders. Army organizations execute missions and tasks.\nStrategic leaders apply a global, regional, national, and societal perspective to the organizations they lead.\nOrganizational and strategic leaders lead through others. Rank does not generally determine the difference\nbetween organizational and strategic leaders, positions do. The Sergeant Major of the Army is a sergeant\nmajor. A battalion sergeant major is also a sergeant major. While there are significant differences in seniority\nand responsibilities, they are both sergeant majors. Junior leaders and some DA Civilians serve at the direct\nleadership level. NCOs and officers that direct other leaders to accomplish tasks are organizational leaders.\nGenerally, senior grade and general officers and equivalent senior executive service DA Civilians and their\nsergeants major serve at the organizational or strategic leadership levels.\nDIRECT LEADERSHIP\n1-65. Direct leadership is face-to-face or first-line leadership that generally occurs in organizations where\nsubordinates see their leaders all the time such as teams, squads, sections, platoons, departments, companies,\nbatteries, and troops. The direct leader's span of influence may range from a few to dozens of people. The\nleader's day-to-day involvement is important for successful unit performance. Direct level leadership covers\nthe same type of functions, such as those performed by an infantry squad or a graves registration unit.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 1-13",
            "Chapter 1\n1-66. Direct leaders develop others through coaching, counseling, mentoring, and setting the example. For\ninstance, company grade officers and NCOs are close enough to Soldiers to exert direct influence when\nobserving training or interacting with subordinates during other functions.\n1-67. Direct leaders generally experience more certainty and less complexity than organizational and\nstrategic leaders because of their close physical proximity to their subordinates. They direct actions, assign\ntasks, teach, coach, encourage, give guidance, and ensure successful completion of tasks or missions. They\nmust be close enough to the action to determine or address problems. Examples of direct leadership tasks are\nvehicle maintenance, supervision of creating of fighting positions, and performance counseling.\n1-68. Direct leaders understand the mission of their higher headquarters two levels up and when applicable\nthe tasks assigned one level down. This provides them with the context in which they perform their duties.\nORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP\n1-69. Organizational leaders exercise leadership through subordinate leaders responsible for leading the\nvarious organizations that make up the larger organization. Organizational leaders establish a climate that\nsupports their subordinate leaders. Subordinate units and organizations do not depend on daily guidance from\ntheir higher-level leaders to be successful. Organizational leaders, particularly commanders, are responsible\nfor communicating intent two echelons down and understanding intent two echelons up. Organizational\nleaders operate within commanders\u2019 intent and communicate that intent to subordinates as a means of\nproviding room for subordinate initiative and decreasing the number of decisions they must personally make\nto keep the organization operating effectively. Organizational leadership includes responsibility over multiple\nfunctions, such as leading and synchronizing combined arms operations.\n1-70. Organizational leaders regularly and personally interact with their subordinates. They make time to\nverify that reports and briefings match their own perceptions of the organization's progress toward mission\naccomplishment. Organizational leaders use personal observation and visits by designated personnel to assess\nhow well subordinates understand the commander's intent and to determine if they need to reinforce or\nreassess the organization's priorities.\nSTRATEGIC LEADERSHIP\n1-71. Strategic leaders include military and civilian leaders at the major command through DOD levels.\nStrategic leadership guides and integrates multiple organizational level units that perform a wide range of\nfunctions. It influences several thousand to hundreds of thousands of people. These leaders allocate resources,\ncommunicate strategic vision, and prepare their commands and the Army itself for future missions. Strategic\nleaders shape Army culture by ensuring their directives, policies, programs, and systems are ethical, effective,\nand efficient.\n1-72. Strategic leaders apply all core leader competencies they acquired as direct and organizational leaders,\nwhile further adapting them to the complex realities of their strategic conditions. Strategic leader decisions\nmust consider congressional hearings, Army budgetary constraints, new systems acquisition, civilian\nprograms, research, development, and inter-service cooperation. Every strategic leader decision has the\npotential of affecting the entire Army.\n1-73. Strategic leaders are important catalysts for change and transformation. Because they follow a long-\nterm approach to planning, preparing, executing, and assessing, they often do not see their ideas come to\nfruition during their tenure. Army modernization is an example where long-range strategic planning is\nnecessary. Relying on many subordinate leader teams, the Army depends on organizational leaders to endorse\nthe long-term strategic vision and ensure it reaches all of the Army. Because they exert influence primarily\nthrough their senior staffs and subordinates, strategic leaders must have excellent judgment when selecting\nand developing subordinates for critical duty positions.\n1-14 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "PART ONE\nThe Army Leader: Person of Character, Presence,\nand Intellect\nPart One highlights the critical attribute categories of character, presence, and\nintellect. All Army leaders use them to reach their full potential from direct leader to\nstrategic leader. The attributes support leadership actions valuable for continued\ndevelopment and effective performance.\nChapter 2\nCharacter\nFOUNDATIONS OF ARMY LEADER CHARACTER\nA person\u2019s character affects how they lead. A leader\u2019s character consists of their true nature guided by\ntheir conscience, which affects their moral attitudes and actions. A leader\u2019s personal reputation is what others\nview as character. Leaders who firmly adhere to applicable laws, regulations, and unit standards build\ncredibility with their subordinates and enhance trust of the Nation they serve.\nInfluences such as background, beliefs, education, and experiences affect all Soldiers and DA\nCivilians. An Army leader\u2019s role in developing others\u2019 character would be simple if it merely required\nchecking and aligning personal values with the Army Values. Reality is much different. Becoming and\nremaining a leader of character is a process involving day-to-day experiences and internal fortitude. While\neducation, self-development, counseling, coaching, and mentoring can refine the outward signs of character,\nmodifying deeply held values is the only way to change character. Leaders are responsible for their own\ncharacter and for encouraging, supporting, and assessing their subordinates\u2019 efforts to embody character.\nCharacter consists of the moral and ethical qualities of an individual revealed through their decisions\nand actions. Leaders must consistently demonstrate good character and inspire others to do the same. The\nclose teamwork demanded to execute military missions at all levels requires that everyone in the Army share\ncertain desirable character attributes. A summary of the character attributes are shown in table 2-1 (see page\n2-12). Character attributes that are of special interest to the Army and its leaders are\u2014\n\uf06c Army Values.\n\uf06c Empathy.\n\uf06c Warrior Ethos and Service Ethos.\n\uf06c Discipline.\n\uf06c Humility.\nARMY VALUES\nPersonal values develop over the years from childhood to adulthood. People are free to choose and\nhold their own values, but upon taking the oath of service, Soldiers and DA Civilians agree to live and act by\nthe Army Values.

Living, teaching, and reinforcing Army Values is an important leader responsibility.\nThe Army recognizes seven values that all Soldiers and DA Civilians must internalize. Embracing the\nArmy Values is the hallmark of being an Army professional. Doing so represents a pact with teammates and\nthe American people to be trustworthy and accountable. When read in sequence, the first letters of the Army\nValues form the acronym LDRSHIP:\n\uf06c Loyalty.\n\uf06c Duty.\n\uf06c Respect.\n\uf06c Selfless service.\n\uf06c Honor.\n\uf06c Integrity.\n\uf06c Personal courage.\nLOYALTY: BEAR TRUE FAITH AND ALLEGIANCE TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, THE ARMY,\nYOUR UNIT AND OTHER SOLDIERS.\nThe first order of loyalty is to the Constitution and the ideals upon which it is based. One cannot remain\nloyal to the Constitution by being loyal to those who violate it. To create strong organizations, superiors,\nsubordinates, and peers must embrace loyalty. One way that individuals demonstrate loyalty is by upholding\nall of the Army values. With those values as a foundation, loyalty is a two-way exchange: leaders earn loyalty\nand subordinates expect loyalty in return. Leaders earn subordinates\u2019 loyalty by training them well, treating\nthem fairly, and living the Army Values. Subordinates demonstrate loyalty by working hard for their leaders\nand being as good as they can be at their jobs. Loyalty and trust enable the successful day-to-day operations\nof all organizations.\nDUTY: FULFILL YOUR OBLIGATIONS\u2014ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST.\nAll Soldiers and DA Civilians strive to do their best. Duty extends beyond law, regulation, and orders.\nArmy professionals exercise initiative when they fulfill the purpose, not merely the letter, of received orders.\nLeaders take responsibility for their actions and those of their subordinates; it is inherent in their duty to the\nlarger organization, the Army, and the Nation. Conscientious leaders and subordinates possess a sense of\nresponsibility to apply their best efforts to accomplish the mission.

In the Army, each is judged by the content\nof their character. Army leaders should consistently foster a climate that treats everyone with dignity and\nrespect, regardless of ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, creed, or religious belief.

Variation in\nupbringing, culture, religious belief, and tradition is reflected among those who choose to serve in the Army.\nSuch diversity provides many benefits for a force globally engaged around the world. Good leaders value\nthis diversity of outlook and experience and must treat all individuals with the inherent dignity and respect\ndue every person. All leaders have the critical responsibility to ensure that subordinates adhere to the Army\nValues as well as standards consistent with the United States Constitution, the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice, and Army rules and regulations.\nThe United States Constitution, which all Soldiers and DA Civilians swear to uphold and defend,\nreflects the Nation's values and is the legal foundation for both our government and the rights of individuals.\nAt times, tensions can arise between individual beliefs protected by the Bill of Rights and the provisions of\nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice or other Army rules and regulations. If this tension arises, it often\ncenters on issues of religious belief, which while protected by the Constitution in general, could conflict with\na specific military rule or regulation. If such tension arises, commanders will lead their organizations\nconsistent with the Army Values while making decisions pursuant to DOD and Army policies.\nValues and beliefs create a foundation for ethical conduct. Adhering to the Army Values is essential\nto upholding high ethical standards of behavior. Unethical behavior quickly destroys organizational morale\nand cohesion\u2014it undermines the trust and confidence essential to teamwork and mission accomplishment.\nConsistently doing the right thing for the right reasons forges strong character in individuals and expands to\ncreate a culture of trust throughout the organization.\n2-6 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Character\nCaptain Humbert R. Versace\nVietnam Captivity\nCaptain Humbert \u201cRocky\u201d Versace was a West Point graduate assigned to the military\nassistance advisory group as an intelligence advisor during October 1963.\nWhile accompanying a Civilian Irregular Defense Group engaged in combat\noperations, Versace and two fellow special forces Soldiers were taken prisoner.\nThey were forced to walk barefoot deep into the jungle. Once there, Versace assumed\nthe position of senior prisoner and demanded the captors treat them as prisoners, not\nwar criminals. He tried to escape four times, once crawling through the surrounding\nswamp until he was recaptured. He garnered most of the attention of the Viet Cong so\nthat life was tolerable for his fellow prisoners. He was their role model.\nHe refused to violate the Code of Conduct, giving the enemy only information required\nby the Geneva Convention, which he would recite repeatedly.\nWhen other Soldiers operated in those remote areas, they heard stories of Versace\u2019s\nordeal from local farmers. Speaking fluent Vietnamese and French, he would resist his\ncaptors loudly enough that local villagers could hear him. They reported seeing him led\nthrough the area barefoot with a rope around his neck, hands tied, and head swollen\nand yellow from jaundice. His hair had turned white from the physical stress. The\nfarmers spoke of his strength, character, and commitment to God and country.\nOn 26 September 1965, after two years in captivity, he was executed in retaliation for\nthree Viet Cong killed in Da Nang. Versace\u2019s remains were never found, but a\ntombstone bearing his name stands above an empty grave in Arlington cemetery.\nIronically, he was just weeks from leaving the Army to become a missionary before\nbeing captured. He wanted to return to Vietnam to help orphaned children. Most of all,\nhe is remembered as someone with strong character and beliefs who never gave in.\nFor his bravery, Versace received the Medal of Honor and induction into the Ranger\nHall of Fame at Fort Benning.\nETHICAL REASONING\nTo be an ethical leader requires more than merely knowing the Army Values. Leaders must be able to\nlive by them to find moral solutions to diverse problems. Ethical reasoning must occur in everything leaders\ndo\u2014in planning, preparing, executing, and assessing operations.\nEthical choices may not always be obvious decisions between right and wrong. Leaders use multiple\nperspectives to think about ethical concerns, applying them to determine the most ethical choice. One\nperspective comes from a view that desirable virtues such as courage, justice, and benevolence define ethical\noutcomes. A second perspective comes from a set of agreed-upon values or rules, such as the Army Values\nor Constitutional rights. A third perspective bases the consequences of the decision on whatever produces the\ngreatest good for the greatest number as most favorable. Leaders able to consider all perspectives applicable\nto a particular situation are more likely to be ethically astute. When time is available, consulting peers and\nseniors is often helpful. Chaplains can provide confidential advice to leaders about difficult personal and\nprofessional ethical issues to encourage moral decisions in accord with personal conscience and the Army\nValues.\nLeaders should not intentionally issue vague or ambiguous orders or instructions to avoid responsibility\nor accountability. Leaders have a responsibility to research relevant orders, rules, and regulations and to\ndemand clarification of orders that could lead to criminal misinterpretation or abuse. Ultimately, Army\nleaders must accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions and the subordinates who execute the\nleader\u2019s orders.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 2-7",
            "Chapter 2\nETHICAL ORDERS\nMaking the right choice and acting when faced with an ethical question can be difficult. Sometimes\nthe situation requires a leader to stand firm and disagree with a supervisor on ethical grounds. These occasions\ntest one\u2019s character and moral courage. Situations in which any Army member thinks an order is unlawful\ncan be the most difficult.\nUnder typical circumstances, a leader executes a superior leader\u2019s decision with enthusiasm. Unlawful\norders are the exception: a leader has a duty to question such orders and refuse to obey them if clarification\nof the order\u2019s intent fails to resolve objections. If a Soldier perceives an order is unlawful, the Soldier should\nfully understand the order\u2019s details and original intent. The Soldier should seek immediate clarification from\nthe person who issued the order before proceeding.\nIf the question is more complex, seek legal counsel. If an issue requires an immediate decision, as may\nhappen in the heat of combat, make the best judgment possible based on the Army Values, personal\nexperience, critical thinking, previous study, and prior reflection. Chances are, when a Soldier disobeys what\nmay be an unlawful order, it may be the most courageous decision they make. The Soldier\u2019s Rules codify the\nlaw of war and outline ethical and lawful conduct in operations (see AR 350-1). They distill the essence of\nthe law of war, the Army Values, and inform ethical conduct.\nEMPATHY\nArmy leaders show empathy when they genuinely relate to another person\u2019s situation, motives, or\nfeelings. Empathy does not mean sympathy for another, but a realization that leads to a deeper understanding.\nEmpathy allows the leader to anticipate what others are experiencing and feeling and gives insight to how\ndecisions or actions affect them. Leaders extend empathy to others in both their leader and follower roles.\nLeaders with a strong tendency for empathy can apply it to understand people at a deeper level. This applies\nto DA Civilians, Soldiers and their Families, local populations, victims of natural disasters, and enemy\ncombatants. Empathy enhances cultural understanding and enables an Army leader to better interact with\nothers.\nEmpathetic leaders are better communicators, help others to understand what is occurring, and inspire\nothers to meet mission objectives. During operations, Army leaders gain empathy when they share hardships\nto gauge Soldier morale and combat readiness. They recognize the need to provide reasonable comforts and\nrest periods to maintain morale and accomplish the mission.\nArmy leaders recognize that empathy includes nurturing a close relationship between the Army and\nArmy families. Army leaders at all levels should promote healthy families and relate to the challenges they\nface. Empathy for families includes providing recovery time from difficult missions, protecting leave periods,\nand supporting events that allow information exchange and family team building.\nWARRIOR ETHOS AND SERVICE ETHOS\nThe Warrior Ethos, contained within the Soldier\u2019s Creed and italicized in the text below, represents\nthe professional attitudes and beliefs that characterize the American Soldier. It reflects a Soldier\u2019s selfless\ncommitment to the Nation, mission, unit, and fellow Soldiers. DA Civilians, while not Soldiers, embody the\nprinciples of the Warrior Ethos through a service ethos embedded within the Army Civilian Corps Creed that\nshapes their conduct with the same commitment. Leaders develop and sustain the Warrior Ethos through\ndiscipline, commitment to the Army Values, and pride in the Army\u2019s heritage. Embodied by Soldiers and\nsupported by DA Civilians, the Warrior Ethos is the foundation for the esprit de corps that permeates the\nArmy.\n2-8 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",

Ambiguous situations, such as when to use lethal or nonlethal\nforce, are a test of the leader\u2019s judgment and discipline. The Warrior Ethos creates a collective commitment\nto succeed with honor.\nThe Warrior Ethos connects Soldiers of today with those whose sacrifices have sustained America\u2019s\nexistence. The Warrior Ethos is crucial but Soldier commitment may be perishable. Consequently, the Army\nmust continually affirm, develop, and sustain its Warrior Ethos. The key to the Warrior Ethos is a mindset\ndeveloped through purposeful mental preparation.

All leaders must demonstrate self-\ndiscipline\u2014the ability to control one\u2019s own behavior\u2014to do the harder right over the easier wrong. Doing\ntasks to the established Army standard without deviation reflects discipline.\nIndividual discipline supports the unit or an organization. At the unit level, leaders maintain discipline\nby enforcing standards impartially and consistently. Often this involves attending to mundane details, which\nmay seem less urgent than an organization's key tasks, but are necessary to ensure success. Examples include\npreventive maintenance checks and services, pre-combat checks and inspections, effective Command Supply\nDiscipline Programs, Organizational Inspection Programs, and training management. When enforcing\nstandards, Soldiers expect their leaders to do so in an impartial, transparent, just, and consistent manner.\n2-10 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Character\nDiscipline in the Face of the Enemy\nIraq\u201428 February 1991\nAbout a half-hour prior to the cease-fire, a T-55 tank pulled up to an American Bradley\nunit that immediately prepared to engage with tube launched, optically tracked, wire\nguided (commonly called TOW) missiles. A vehicle section consisting of the platoon\nsergeant and his wingman tracked the Iraqi tank, ready to unleash two deadly shots.\nSuddenly, the wingman saw the T-55 stop; a head popped up from the commander\u2019s\ncupola. The wingman immediately radioed his platoon sergeant to hold fire, believing\nthe Iraqi was about to dismount, possibly to surrender.\nThe Iraqi tank crew jumped out and ran behind a sand dune. Sensing something was\noff, the platoon sergeant immediately instructed his wingman to investigate the area,\nwhile he provided cover. To everyone\u2019s surprise, the wingman discovered 150 enemy\ncombatants ready to surrender. To deal with this large number of prisoners, the\nAmericans lined them up for disarming and checking for items of intelligence value.\nThen the unit called for prisoner of war handlers to pick the Iraqis up.\nBefore moving on, the platoon sergeant had to destroy the T-55. Before blowing it in\nplace, the noncommissioned officer had the tank moved behind a sand berm to protect\nhis people and the prisoners from the shrapnel of the on-board munitions.\nWhen the tank suddenly exploded and the ammunition cooked-off, the prisoners\npanicked, believing the Americans would shoot them. Quickly, the Soldiers\ncommunicated that this would not happen, one saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re from America, we\ndon\u2019t shoot our prisoners!\u201d\nHUMILITY\nHumility in its simplest form is the absence of arrogance. It is a sign of a leader being unselfish,\nworking toward something more important than themselves. A person of high integrity, honesty, and\ncharacter embodies the qualities of humility. For humility to apply, a leader must first have competence and\nconfidence. A leader with the right level of humility is a willing learner, maintains accurate self-awareness,\nand seeks out others\u2019 input and feedback. Leaders are seen as humble when they are aware of their limitations\nand abilities and apply that understanding in their leadership.\nHumility exists on a continuum. Too little humility represents arrogance or hubris, which may lead to\noverconfidence. Excess humility is problematic because it is interpreted as shyness, meekness, passivity,\nblind obedience, or timidity. Either extreme signals a lack of self-awareness that undermines followers\u2019 trust\nand confidence in the leader\u2019s ability to make good decisions, look out for the unit\u2019s welfare, and to achieve\nsuccess.\nIt is difficult to judge our own humility. One\u2019s humility is largely determined by other people. It is a\nsubjective perception of the leader. Humility is interpreted differently by different genders and cultures.\nIndividuals need to guard against their biases and assess character based on the whole set of Army Values\nand attributes.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 2-11",

            "Chapter 3\nPresence\nFOUNDATIONS OF ARMY LEADER PRESENCE\n3-1. Demonstrating presence is more than just showing up and being seen, although both are important.\nThe actions, words, and the manner in which leaders carry themselves should convey confidence,\ncompetence, and a positive example for others to emulate. Presence represents who leaders are and what they\nstand for. Every leader has presence. Unfortunately, some lose the respect and confidence of their\nsubordinates because their presence provides little or no positive effect on others. Part of projecting a positive\nleadership presence is being comfortable in one\u2019s own skin. While leaders should understand that their\nsubordinates are always observing how leaders carry themselves, they should also understand that\nsubordinates can quickly tell the difference between leaders who are trying to portray themselves as\nsomething they are not. This often happens when a leader is new to a duty position or lacks experience.\nRemembering that most subordinates want their leaders to be successful is important. When they sense that\ntheir leaders are genuine, honest, and willing to learn by putting themselves into positions where they might\nrisk a little embarrassment learning a new skill, their level of respect for a leader increases. Leaders able to\ndo what they ask others to do, who can \u2018walk the talk,\u2019 generate a positive reputation that contributes to their\neffective presence around Soldiers. Table 3-1 is a summary of the presence attributes (see page 3-3).\n3-2. Through their presence, leaders show what they stand for and how they expect others to carry\nthemselves. Leaders who routinely share in hardships and dangers have firsthand knowledge of what they\nare asking subordinates to do, and show their subordinates that they are not above putting themselves at the\nsame level of risk or discomfort. It assures Soldiers that what they are doing is important. A leader\u2019s\neffectiveness is dramatically enhanced by understanding and developing the following areas:\n\uf06c Military and professional bearing: projecting a commanding presence, a professional image of\nauthority, calmness under pressure, and control over emotions.\n\uf06c Fitness: looking like a fit, professional Soldier, having the strength, and endurance to lead others\nfrom the front, and being physically able to do what subordinates are expected to do.\n\uf06c Confidence: projecting self-confidence and certainty in the unit\u2019s ability to accomplish the\nmission, able to retain composure and demonstrate calm through steady control over emotion.\n\uf06c Resilience: demonstrating the psychological and physical capacity to overcome failures, setbacks,\nand hardship.\nMILITARY AND PROFESSIONAL BEARING\n3-3. The Army expects all Army members to look and act as professionals. Skillful use of professional\nbearing\u2014fitness, courtesy, proper military appearance, appropriate civilian attire, and professionally correct\nbehavior in accordance with established Army standards sets the professional tone with which a unit\nfunctions. A professional military demeanor establishes credibility, sets expectations, and reduces\norganizational ambiguity. Consistent professionalism strengthens mutual respect among members of the\nteam.\nFITNESS\n3-4. The Army\u2019s approach to holistic fitness reduces the risk of unnecessary harm during operations, while\ntraining, in garrison, and off duty. Holistic fitness recognizes that individual well-being depends on\ninterdependent areas including physical fitness (see FM 7-22), resilience, training, individual spirituality\n(self-identity, beliefs, and life purpose beyond self), social interaction (positive connection with others), and\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 3-1",

Unit readiness begins with physically fit Soldiers. Operations place physical, mental, and emotional\ndemands upon the individuals conducting them. Physical fitness, while crucial for success in battle, is\nimportant for all members of the Army team in all environments. Physically fit people feel more competent\nand confident, handle stress better, can work longer more effectively, and recover faster from hardship.\nPhysical fitness is the cornerstone of combat readiness.\n3-6. The physical demands of leadership during repeated deployments or continuous operations can erode\nhow well one thinks and emotional stability, both of which are essential to the effective decision making\nrequired for sound leadership. Poor physical fitness multiples the effects of stress, eventually compromising\nmental and emotional fitness. Operations in difficult terrain, extreme climates, or high altitudes require\nextensive physical conditioning. Once in the area of operations, leaders must continue efforts to sustain their\nown fitness and that of their subordinates.\n3-7. Preparedness for operational missions should be the primary focus of the unit\u2019s fitness program. The\nforward-looking leader develops a balanced fitness program that enables Soldiers to execute the unit\u2019s most\nchallenging missions.\n3-8. It is a leader\u2019s duty to stay healthy and fit since the leader\u2019s decisions affect the welfare of the entire\norganization. Fit and healthy leaders motivate and challenge subordinates to become like them. Staying\nhealthy and physically fit enables Soldiers to cope with the psychological effects of extended operations. To\nmaintain peak performance, leaders and Soldiers need exercise, sufficient sleep, nutritional food, and\nadequate hydration.\n3-9. Health fitness includes having routine physical exams and keeping immunizations current, as well as\npracticing dental hygiene, personal grooming, and cleanliness when in the field during training and\noperations. Health fitness includes avoiding things that can degrade personal health, such as, substance abuse,\ntobacco use, over-eating, as well as overuse of caffeine, energy drinks, and other stimulants (for more\ninformation see FM 7-22).\nCONFIDENCE\n3-10. Confidence is the faith leaders place in their abilities to make decisions and take appropriate action in\nany situation, no matter how stressful or ambiguous. Confidence grows from professional competence and a\nrealistic appraisal of one\u2019s abilities. A leader\u2019s confidence is contagious and permeates the entire\norganization. Confident leaders who help Soldiers control doubt reduce anxiety in a unit. Effective leaders\ntemper confidence with humility\u2014the understanding that no one is perfect, all knowing, or always correct.\nHumility prevents overconfidence and arrogance.\nRESILIENCE\n3-11. Resilience enables leaders and their organizations to endure and ultimately prevail over hardship.\nResilience and commitment to accomplish the mission is critical to overcoming adversity.

Intellect consists of one\u2019s brainpower and knowledge.\nIntellect enables leaders to think creatively and critically to gain situational understanding, make sound\njudgments, solve problems, and take action. Intellect allows leaders to reason analytically, critically,\nethically, and with cultural sensitivity. Intellect is involved in considering the intended and unintended\nconsequences of the decisions a leader makes. Effective leaders must anticipate the second- and third-order\neffects of their decisions.\n4-2. A leader\u2019s mental abilities affect how well they think and lead others. People differ in intellectual\nstrengths and ways of thinking\u2014there is no one right way to think. Each leader needs to be self-aware of\ntheir strengths and limitations and apply them accordingly. Experience informs intellect. Table 4-1 is a\nsummary of the intellect attributes (see page 4-5).\n4-3. The leader attributes making up an Army leader\u2019s intellect include\u2014\n\uf06c Mental agility.\n\uf06c Sound judgment.\n\uf06c Innovation.\n\uf06c Interpersonal tact.\n\uf06c Expertise.\nMENTAL AGILITY\n4-4. Mental agility is the ability to think flexibly. Mental agility helps leaders effectively react to change\nand adapt to the dynamic situations inherent to military operations. Mental agility keeps leaders from fixating\non the wrong problems or getting stuck on poor solutions. Agility enables thinking when current decisions\nor actions are not producing the desired results and a new approach is necessary. Mental agility in leaders\nand followers provides organizations with the adaptability necessary for the disciplined initiative essential to\nmission command.\n4-5. Mental agility relies upon curiosity and the ability to reason critically. Inquisitive or intellectually\ncurious leaders are eager to understand a broad range of topics and keep an open mind to multiple possibilities\nbefore reaching decisions. Critical thinking is purposeful and helps find facts, challenge assumptions, solve\nproblems, and make decisions. Critical thinking enables understanding of changing situations, arriving at\njustifiable conclusions, making judgments, and learning from experience. Critical and creative thinking\nprovide the basis for understanding, visualizing, and describing complex, ill-structured problems and\ndeveloping approaches to solve them. Critical thinking provides a basis for reflection and continual learning.\nCreative thinking involves thinking in innovative ways using imagination, insight, and novel ideas. Critical\nand innovative thought are abilities that enable adaptability.\n4-6. Critical thinking examines a problem in depth from multiple points of view. The first and most\nimportant step in finding an appropriate solution is to isolate the main problem. A leader\u2019s mental agility to\nquickly isolate a problem and identify solutions facilitates seizing initiative and adapting effectively during\noperations when many things occur simultaneously and in close succession. Leaders must instill agility and\ninitiative within subordinates by creating a climate that encourages risk taking within the commander\u2019s intent.\nUnderwriting risk and accepting honest mistakes in training makes subordinates more likely to develop and\ntake initiative.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 4-1",
            "Chapter 4\nSOUND JUDGMENT\nJudgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgments.\nGeneral of the Army Omar N. Bradley\nAddress at the U.S. Army War College (1971)\n4-7. Judgment requires the capacity to assess situations accurately, draw rational conclusions, and make\ndecisions. Sound judgment enables leaders to make sensible decisions in a timely manner, a quality critical\nto building trust with subordinates and earning their confidence. Experience contributes to the development\nof sound judgment when it contributes to learning. Leaders acquire experience through trial and error and by\nobserving others. Learning from others can occur through mentoring and coaching (see chapter 6).\n4-8. Often, leaders must balance facts, question assumptions, and sense intangible factors like morale or\nthe enemy\u2019s intent. Judgment contributes to the ability to compare possible courses of action and decide what\none to take. There are times, particularly in combat, where there are no good decisions, only the least bad\ndecision possible in the moment. Sound judgment requires consideration of consequences. It also includes\nthe ability to assess strengths and weaknesses of subordinates, peers, and the enemy. Like mental agility,\nsound judgment is a critical part of problem solving and decision making.\nINNOVATION\n4-9. Innovation describes the ability to introduce or implement something new. Innovative problem solvers\ntend to be inquisitive, looking to understand why something is the way it is or questioning how something\ncould work better. Being innovative requires creative thinking that uses both adaptive (drawing from\nexpertise and prior knowledge) and innovative approaches (developing completely new ideas).\n4-10. Innovative leaders prevent complacency by finding new ways to challenge subordinates with\nalternative approaches and ideas. They recognize that other people have good ideas and they recognize those\nwho do. To be innovators, leaders rely on intuition, experience, knowledge, and input from subordinates,\npeers, and superiors. Innovative leaders reinforce team building by making everybody responsible for\u2014and\nstakeholders in\u2014innovation.\nGatlings to the Assault\nSan Juan Hill, Santiago de Cuba\u20141 July 1898\nAn important yet little known incident in American arms occurred during the assault on\nSan Juan Hill in the war with Spain.

Parker was in command of the\nGatling Gun Detachment composed of men from four different infantry regiments.\nParker believed that his guns, which normally played only a defensive role in battle,\ncould be of decisive importance in the attack by giving fire superiority to the infantry\njust when most needed. Receiving permission to advance the guns, Parker brought\nhis detachment abreast of the Infantry, in fact ahead of some elements of it, and\nopened fire. This, the United States Army's first use of close support machine guns in\nthe attack, was decisive in the capture of San Juan Hill. Lieutenant Parker's initiative\ndeveloped an important principle of fire and maneuver\u2014the use of close support\nmachine guns in the attack.\nINTERPERSONAL TACT\n4-11. Effectively interacting with others is a skill that requires self-awareness. Interpersonal tact is a\ncomponent of professional behavior. Interpersonal tact relies on understanding the character, reactions, and\nmotives of oneself and others. It can be distilled down to the idea of honestly stating one\u2019s views about an\nidea or another person as diplomatically as possible to ensure it is understood without causing unnecessary\noffense. Tact should be balanced by professional candor, in terms of saying what needs to be said or done for\nthe good of the mission or the unit. Leaders, who understand how subordinates, peers, and superiors view\n4-2 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",

Candor and tact are\nimportant aspects of personal composure and an element for effectively leading diverse organizations.\nRECOGNIZING DIVERSITY\n4-12. Personal perspectives vary within every individual human being and societal groups. Understanding\nthe different backgrounds, qualifications, experiences, and potential of each of the individuals in an\norganization is an important part of being an effective leader. It is fundamental to knowing your people and\nharnessing their diverse skills and perspectives to build cohesive teams. Good leaders create conditions where\nsubordinates know they are valued for their individual talents, skills, and perspectives that contribute to\nmission accomplishment.\nCOMPOSURE\n4-13. Effective leaders control their emotions. Emotional self-control, balance, and stability enable leaders\nto make sound, ethical decisions. Leaders must remain calm under pressure and expend energy on things they\ncan positively influence rather than those things they cannot affect. An Army leader\u2019s level of self-control\ngreatly influences how they interact with others, particularly during periods of crisis when things are not\ngoing well. Leaders understand that emotional energy sparks motivation and endurance. Enthusiastic leaders,\nwho are in control of their emotions, will be able to energize others to rise above difficult conditions.\n4-14. A leader\u2019s emotional state influences subordinates\u2019 emotions. Balancing the right level and mix of\nemotions for a situation provides confidence. Extreme, rash displays of emotion can threaten subordinate\nconfidence in a leader\u2019s judgment. Displaying panic or no emotion at all are opposite extremes. A sense of\ncalm encourages feedback from subordinates, improving communication while contributing to shared\nunderstanding. Self-control in combat is especially important\u2014emotions like rage, panic, or fear can be\ncontagious. Leaders who lose their composure cannot expect subordinates to maintain theirs. Practicing\ncomposure in garrison and training events provides the experience a leader can draw upon during crisis.\n4-15. Effective leaders can read others\u2019 emotional states to employ the right balance of interpersonal tact and\ncandor in a particular situation. They draw on experience to provide subordinates the proper perspective on\nunfolding events. They possess a range of attitudes, from relaxed to intense, from which to choose\nappropriately for the circumstances they face. Balanced leaders know how to convey urgency without\nthrowing the entire organization into chaos.\n4-16. Effective leaders are steady, levelheaded when under pressure and tired, and calm when facing danger.\nThey model the emotions they want their subordinates to display and resist temptation to do or say what\npersonally feels justified. They remember that venting frustrations publicly may seem to release stress, but\nactually tends to increase stress across the organization when not done judiciously for sound reasons.\nThose Guys Can\u2019t Shoot\nThe cordon was beginning to collapse. The enemy had taken random shots at the\nplatoon and the gunners were hunkered down behind their shields. The platoon leader\nopened the door to get in the vehicle. An insurgent on a scooter darted out from an\nalley and shot, hitting the inside of the open door. The platoon leader got in, stared at\nhis frightened driver, and said, \u201cThose guys can\u2019t shoot.\u201d\nWhile this may come across as bravado, it was not. The platoon leader was just as\nsurprised and frightened as the driver was; however, in the moment he knew that he\nneeded to say something to distract his driver.\nEXPERTISE\n4-17. Expertise is in-depth knowledge and skill developed from experience, training, and education. Leaders\nuse in-depth knowledge to focus on key aspects of a problem, make effective and ethical decisions, and\nachieve a high level of performance. Leaders have a moral obligation to those they lead to improve their\nexpertise continuously. Leaders themselves should be open and eager to benefit from others\u2019 knowledge to\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 4-3",

Tactical knowledge relates to accomplishing military objectives during operations. Technical\nknowledge consists of specialized information associated with a function or system. Joint knowledge is an\nunderstanding of joint organizations, procedures, and roles in national defense. Cultural and geopolitical\nknowledge is awareness of cultural, geographic, and political differences and sensitivities.\nTACTICAL KNOWLEDGE\n4-18. Army leaders must know the fundamentals of their duty position related to warfighting, tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures. Their tactical knowledge allows them to employ individuals, teams, and\norganizations properly to accomplish missions at least cost in lives and materiel. Competent readiness-\nfocused leaders seek professional military education opportunities to develop tactical knowledge and demand\nrealistic operational conditions during training. They do this for themselves and their subordinates.\n4-19. Fieldcraft is an essential element of tactical knowledge that leaders must understand, teach, and enforce\nduring both training and operations. Fieldcraft encompasses all of the techniques associated with operating\nand surviving in austere, hostile field conditions, like camouflage, noise and light discipline, and field\nsanitation. Leaders set a positive personal example in terms of fieldcraft and ensure subordinates adhere to\nprescribed standards in a disciplined manner. Good fieldcraft is an indicator of a well-disciplined and well-\nled organization. Leaders gain proficiency in fieldcraft through education and practice during training.\nTECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE\n4-20. Technical knowledge relates to equipment, weapons, systems, and functional areas. Leaders need to\nknow how the equipment for which they are responsible works and how to use it. Subordinates generally\nexpect their organizational leaders to be technically competent, and their direct leaders to be technically\nexpert.\n4-21. Leaders ensure their subordinates know how to operate and maintain their equipment, which often\nrequires setting an example with a hands-on approach. They understand and explain critical equipment\ncapabilities, strengths, and weaknesses. They provide context for the employment of friendly technical\ncapabilities to their subordinates, which means leaders must also understand the operational environments in\nwhich they are used.\nJOINT KNOWLEDGE\n4-22. Leaders acquire joint knowledge through formal training in the joint professional military education\nprogram and experience from assignments in joint organizations. Army leaders must understand how to\nintegrate Army capabilities with those of the other Services and unified action partners, particularly at the\norganizational and strategic levels.\nCULTURAL AND GEOPOLITICAL KNOWLEDGE\n4-23. Army organizations operate around the world in a wide variety of environments with different unified\naction partners representing many different cultures. Leaders should acquire cultural and geopolitical\nknowledge about the areas in which they expect to accomplish the mission.\n4-24. Leaders require cultural and geopolitical awareness to properly prepare subordinates for the places\nthey will work, the people with whom they will operate, and the adversaries or enemies they will face. The\nArmy requires leaders who are geopolitically aware and can explain how their unit mission fits into the\nbroader scheme of operations. These are important factors when Army leaders attempt to extend influence\nbeyond the chain of command.\n4-25. Culture consists of shared beliefs, values, and assumptions. Army leaders are mindful of cultural\nfactors in three contexts:\n\uf06c Sensitivity to unified action partners\u2019 backgrounds to determine how to best use their capabilities.\n\uf06c Awareness of the culture of the area in which the organization is operating.\n\uf06c Consideration of partners\u2019 customs, traditions, doctrinal principles, and operational methods.\n4-4 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",

To operate in a multinational setting,\nArmy leaders must understand differences in doctrinal terminology and the interpretation of orders and\ninstructions.

            "PART TWO\nCompetency-based Leadership for Direct\nThrough Strategic Levels\nPart Two describes the core leader competencies and their application. Army leaders\nlead others; develop themselves, their subordinates, and organizations; and\naccomplish assigned and implied missions. The ten competencies of Army leadership\napply across leadership levels as core requirements, while subtle changes occur in\npurpose and activity at each successive level.\nChapter 5\nLeads\nThe American soldier\u2026demands professional competence in his leaders. In battle, he\nwants to know that the job is going to be done right, with no unnecessary casualties. The\nnoncommissioned officer wearing the chevron is supposed to be the best soldier in the\nplatoon and he is supposed to know how to perform all the duties expected of him. The\nAmerican soldier expects his sergeant to be able to teach him how to do his job. And he\nexpects even more from his officers.\nOmar N. Bradley\nGeneral of the Army (1950-1953)\nLEADS OTHERS\n5-1. Leads consists of five competencies. Leads others includes influencing members in the leader's\norganization. Influence is central to leadership. Extends influence beyond the chain of command involves\ninfluencing others when the leader does not have designated authority or when others may not recognize the\nleader's authority. Builds trust establishes conditions that lead to mutual confidence among leaders and\nsubordinates. Leader actions and words comprise the competencies of leads by example and communicates.\nActions can speak louder than words and leaders who embody standards as role models are generally more\neffective than those who simply talk about standards. Effective leaders clearly communicate what needs to\nbe done and why.\n5-2. Army leaders draw upon their character, presence, and intellect while leading others. Direct leaders\ninfluence others person-to-person, such as a team leader who instructs, encourages hard work, and recognizes\nachievement. Organizational and strategic leaders guide organizations directly through their subordinate\nleaders, using both direct and indirect means of influence. A company commander directly leads the platoon\nleaders, who in turn know what the battalion commander wants done, because the lieutenants understand the\ncommander\u2019s intent two levels up. The battalion commander does not communicate to the platoon leaders\ndirectly, but rather depends upon the company commanders to lead their organizations according to the\ncommander\u2019s intent. Intent links higher and lower echelons.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 5-1",
            "Chapter 5\n5-3. All Army leaders are followers; each reports to someone higher in the chain of command, ultimately\nup to the Secretary of the Army who answers to the President. Leaders inspire and guide subordinates to\nfollow; subordinates react to inspiration and follow guidance while performing their duties. Leaders assess\nand establish rapport with followers, and followers act in good conscience to follow guidance. Whether\nserving in the role of leader or subordinate, all are honor bound to perform their duties to the best of their\nabilities.\n5-4. Context determines when a Soldier or DA Civilian is a leader or follower. A first sergeant receives\nguidance from the company commander as a follower and then as a leader translates that guidance to the\nplatoon sergeants. As a leader, the first sergeant does not simply parrot the guidance received. The first\nsergeant translates the guidance into terms that are appropriate for the company NCOs in the context of other\ninformation received from the battalion command sergeant major and issues instructions that best meet the\ncommander\u2019s intent. The activity of influencing others depends on the followers\u2019 knowledge, skills, and\ncommitment level. The principles of mission command in ADP 6-0 inform the level of control leaders employ\nin a particular situation.\n5-5. Effective leadership depends on the alignment of purpose, direction, and motivation among leaders\nand subordinates. Working with a shared understanding of the operational picture and higher intent generates\nthe unity of purpose, unity of effort, and consistency essential to maintaining a positive leadership climate.\nSubordinates who see consistency will sense shared purpose and be less prone to distraction by confusing or\nconflicting guidance from different leaders. Those who align their decisions and activities with their peers,\nfor example during garrison activities and training, may have greater influence than a leader who does not.\nThis unifying aspect of leadership can\u2014\n\uf06c Ensure attitudes and actions up, down, and across units are aligned around a common vision.\n\uf06c Enable mission command by delegating authority and control appropriate for the situation.\n\uf06c Cultivate mutually beneficial relationships with others inside and outside the organization.\n\uf06c Draw on sources of expertise across a unit.\n5-6. Leading others requires that leaders influence others to conduct tasks, make decisions, and perform\ntheir duty in ways consistent with Army standards. It is the duty of leaders to motivate others to accomplish\nmissions in accordance with the Army Values. Leaders influence others to perform their duties in service of\na higher purpose, not personal gain or advantage. Army leaders can draw on a variety of methods to influence\nothers and can use one or more methods to fit to the specific context of any situation. Some tasks only require\nsubordinate compliance for success, such as meeting the requirement for flu shots. Others require building a\nhigh level of commitment on the behalf of subordinates to achieve success, such as a platoon seizing a heavily\nfortified enemy position. Compliance is the act of conforming to a requirement or demand. Commitment is\nwilling dedication or allegiance to a cause or organization. Active opposition to influence denotes resistance.\nUSING COMPLIANCE AND COMMITMENT\n5-7. Successful leadership depends upon both the compliance and commitment of those being led. Neither\nsucceeds on its own in most situations; rather, there is a blend of compliance and commitment amongst\nsubordinates in each situation. The best leaders generate a sense of commitment that causes subordinates to\ngo beyond achieving the bare minimum. Compliance to legal and ethical orders, directives, and instructions\nis always required. Willing and eager agreement is commitment.\n5-8. Whereas compliance only affects a follower\u2019s behavior, commitment reaches deeper\u2014changing\nattitudes, beliefs, and behavior. Commitment generally produces longer lasting and broader effects that result\nin subordinates being willing to expend more effort of their own accord, or even put themselves at personal\nrisk, to accomplish the tasks at hand. Once a leader builds commitment among followers, they will likely\ndemonstrate more initiative, personal involvement, and creativity. Commitment grows from an individual\u2019s\ndesire to contribute to the organization. Leaders can strengthen commitment by reinforcing followers\u2019\nidentification with the Nation (loyalty), the Army (professionalism), the unit or organization (esprit de corps),\nthe leadership in a unit (respect), and to the mission (duty).\n5-2 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Leads\nMethods of Influence\n5-9. Influence is the essential activity of leadership and refers to how people affect the intentions, attitudes,\nand actions of another person or group of people. Influence depends upon the relationship that develops\nbetween leaders and others. Positive rapport and a sense of mutual trust make subordinates more likely to\nrespond positively to a leader\u2019s influence. Examples of rapport building include having genuine interest in a\nsubordinate\u2019s well-being, offering praise for a job well done, and taking time to understand a subordinate\u2019s\nposition on an issue. Leaders indirectly influence others by demonstrating integrity, empathy, judgment,\nexpertise, and commitment. Army leaders employ various methods of direct influence based on audience,\nintent, and context of the situation. The nine methods listed below represent different ways to influence:\n\uf06c Pressure.\n\uf06c Legitimating.\n\uf06c Exchange.\n\uf06c Personal appeals.\n\uf06c Collaboration.\n\uf06c Rational persuasion.\n\uf06c Apprising.\n\uf06c Inspirational appeals.\n\uf06c Participation.\n5-10. Pressure occurs when leaders use explicit demands to achieve compliance, such as establishing\ndeadlines for the completion of tasks and communicating negative consequences for those not met. This\napproach is generally appropriate under two conditions. The first is when emphasis is required to ensure\ncompliance with previously unmet requirements and subordinates need to reorder their priorities to meet the\nhigher-level intent to do so. The second is during combat operations, when the pressure the leader applies\nexplicitly relates to the negative consequences likely to occur should the subordinates fail. Leaders should\nuse this method infrequently, particularly in garrison, since it tends to create subordinate resentment,\nespecially if the pressure becomes severe. When subordinates perceive that pressures originate from their\nleader\u2019s attempt to please superiors for personal recognition, resentment can quickly undermine an\norganization\u2019s morale, cohesion, and quality of performance. Pressure is a suitable choice when the stakes\nare high, time is short, or previous attempts to direct action have not been successful.\n5-11. Legitimating occurs when leaders establish their authority as the basis for a request when it may not\nbe obvious. Certain tasks must happen regardless of circumstances when subordinate leaders receive\nlegitimate orders from higher headquarters. Reference to one\u2019s position suggests to subordinates that there is\npotential for adverse action if the request is not completed.\n5-12. Exchange is an influence method that leaders use when they offer to provide incentives for gaining a\nhigher level of compliance with orders or instructions. A four-day pass as reward for excelling during a\nmaintenance inspection is an example of exchange. The use of rewards should be impartial and as objective\nas possible.\n5-13. Personal appeals occur when the leader asks for a subordinate\u2019s support based upon their personal or\nlongstanding professional relationship, generally out of loyalty. This may be useful in a difficult situation\nwhen mutual trust is the key to success. The leader makes a special appeal by highlighting special talents the\nsubordinate or team have, as well as the unique bonds they all share before taking on a tough mission. An S3\nmight ask a staff officer to brief a difficult audience at an important conference that makes it clear that the\nsubordinate is the one best suited and most trusted to give the briefing.\n5-14. Collaboration occurs when the leader engages with subordinates or peers to apply influence by\ncontributing to the outcome. The leader is making commitment more attractive to followers by stepping in\nand resolving problems, offering additional resources, or sharing in the work. A collaborative approach works\nwell in many environments. It can increase mutual understanding and clarify commander\u2019s intent while\ngiving subordinates the opportunity to share their ideas and perspective.\n5-15. Rational persuasion requires providing a broader context, logical argument, or explanations showing\nhow a request is relevant to the goal and why something should or must be done. This is often the first\napproach a leader takes to gain compliance or commitment from subordinates and is more effective when\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 5-3",
            "Chapter 5\nothers recognize the leader as an expert. Leaders draw from their own experience to give reasons why a task\nshould be accomplished in a particular manner. Rational persuasion is often used in combination with other\napproaches, particularly collaboration.\n5-16. Apprising happens when the leader explains why an order or request will benefit a subordinate or team,\nsuch as explaining how performing a task a certain way that will save time. In contrast to the exchange\napproach, the benefits of apprising are generally beyond the direct control of the leader to provide. A\ncommander may use the apprising method to inform a newly assigned NCO that serving in a staff position,\nbefore serving as a platoon sergeant, could provide invaluable experience. The commander points out that\nadditional knowledge may make the NCO a stronger candidate for promotion.\n5-17. Inspirational appeals occur when the leader creates enthusiasm for a request by arousing strong\nemotions in support of a decision they must make or have already made. Inspirational appeals are best\nemployed when the stakes are high, and subordinates or peers understand what those stakes are. A leader\nmay stress to a fellow leader that without help, the safety of the team may be at risk.\n5-18. Participation occurs when leaders ask others to join them in determining how best to address a problem\nor meet an objective. Active participation leads to an increased sense of worth and recognition among\nsubordinates that contributes to unit cohesion. Participation increases the commitment of subordinates to\nexecute whatever is decided and contributes to shared understanding of the commander\u2019s intent. By involving\nsubordinate leaders during planning, the senior leader is helping to ensure subordinates will later be able to\npursue critical intermediate and long-term objectives on their own initiative.\nApplication of Influence\n5-19. Creating commitment among subordinates requires that they know their leaders are sincere. Committed\nsubordinates trust their leaders to be doing what is right for the Army, the mission, the team, and each\nindividual Soldier. Leaders who primarily focus on personal gain or recognition are seen by subordinates as\nself-serving, which undermines trust and erodes motivation. Honorable intentions wrongly perceived by\nfollowers as self-serving will yield mere compliance.\n5-20. The nature of the mission determines which influence method or combination of methods is\nappropriate. When a situation is urgent and greater risk is involved, eliciting follower compliance through\nmore directive methods may be desirable. Direct-level leaders are often required to coordinate team activities\nin an expedient manner, meaning that they focus on explaining themselves before or after the activities, and\nnot during execution. In comparison, organizational leaders typically use methods that draw out strong\ncommitment from their subordinate leaders.\n5-21. The degree to which a leader uses commitment or compliance depends on the leader, the led, and the\nsituation. When influencing others, Army leaders understand\u2014\n\uf06c The reasons for influence should align with the Army Values, the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice, the Soldier\u2019s Creed, and the Army Civilian Corps Creed.\n\uf06c Commitment emphasizes empowerment and long-lasting trust.\n\uf06c Compliance focuses on quickly meeting task demands.\nResistance\n5-22. When leaders experience resistance, the first response is to understand the nature of the relationship\nand reasons for opposition or non-compliance. Resistance may stem from a lack of trust, lack of\nunderstanding, or concerns about well-being. Leaders may need to clarify misperceptions or correct false\nbeliefs. Unfounded rumors can hurt unit cohesiveness and create friction if not confronted at their source.\nGossip and rumors reduce focus while increasing the amount of energy leaders must spend on activities other\nthan the mission at hand.\n5-23. Leaders need to ensure all parties focus on a shared understanding. Overt acknowledgement of\nresistance can be the first step in reducing it. Leaders should confront resistance quickly to determine the\nreasons why it exists and how to address the causes constructively. This may be enough to change negative\nmindsets and build or restore mutual trust within the organization. Leaders can lessen resistance by\nacknowledging concerns with their own position or requests. This demonstrates that the leaders recognize\n5-4 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Leads\nboth the positives and negatives of a given request and that they are approaching the issue even-handedly\nand fairly.\n5-24. Repeated, consistent requests can signal that the leader is intent on overcoming resistance. For instance,\nif an Army leader wants local police to participate in patrols, the leader may ask the police to participate a\ndozen times on different occasions. Eventually the repeated requests may wear down resistance. Repetition\ncould have the opposite effect of entrenching the opposition in their original negative position, which would\nsignal the need for a different method. Embedding the desired outcome into stories can show how the actions\nare possible and how all sides can benefit. Regardless of approach taken, leaders must not risk their integrity\nnor wander from their mission for the sole purpose of others perceiving them as influential.\nPROVIDING PURPOSE, DIRECTION, AND MOTIVATION\n5-25. Leaders influence others to achieve some purpose. To be successful at exerting influence, Army leaders\nhave an end or goal in mind. Sometimes the goal will be specific, and at other times, goals are more general,\nbut in both cases, the goal should be valid and meaningful. Leaders should clearly define the \u2018what\u2019 and\n\u2018why\u2019. Subordinates should be able to start the mission or task with the end in mind by knowing what success\nlooks like and how they can track their own progress. Motivation increases when subordinates understand\nhow their roles relate to larger and more important outcomes.\n5-26. Leaders must establish clear understanding of the higher commander\u2019s intent to ensure the team\nunderstands what must be done and why. Commander\u2019s intent is a concise expression of the purpose of an\noperation and the desired end state. Leaders communicate purpose with implied or explicit instructions so\nothers may exercise initiative. This is important for situations when unanticipated opportunities arise or the\noriginal assigned tasks no longer achieve the desired end state.\n5-27. Besides purpose, leaders provide direction. Direction deals with how to achieve a goal, task, or mission.\nSubordinates do not always need to receive guidance on the details of execution. A skilled leader will know\nwhen to provide detailed guidance or promote subordinate initiative by focusing primarily on purpose.\n5-28. Motivation is linked to the reason and level of enthusiasm for doing something. Army leaders use the\nknowledge of what motivates others to influence those they lead. Understanding how motivation works\nprovides insight into why people may take action and how strongly they are driven to act.\n5-29. Setting achievable goals can shape motivation. Leaders can break larger missions into smaller tasks to\nkeep individuals engaged without being overwhelmed by the scale or scope of what needs to be done.\nSubordinates require the necessary skills and abilities to perform the tasks they are assigned, have reason to\nbe committed to the goal, and receive feedback to gauge progress. Task assignment and goal setting account\nfor the capabilities and limitations of those performing the tasks a leader directs. Finally, framing\nperformance goals positively produces better persistence and performance than negative framing.\n5-30. Leaders can encourage subordinates to set goals of their own while setting goals for them in terms of\nduty performance during counseling and coaching. When subordinates accept goals, they are better able to\nprioritize, focus their attention, and gauge the amount of effort necessary to achieve them.\n5-31. Positive reinforcement such as tangible incentives (time off) as well as intangible rewards (praise or\nrecognition) can enhance motivation. Everyone wants their efforts to be appreciated by others. Leaders can\nuse healthy competition to renew intensity, such as recognition for the most improved fitness test score or\ntop crew gunnery score. Leaders can use corrective measures when an immediate need arises to discontinue\ndangerous or undesirable behavior. By doing so, leaders send a clear message about expectations of behavior\nand the consequences of violating those expectations. Administer punishment fairly; otherwise, it leads to\nresentment.\n5-32. Leaders assign responsibility, delegate authority, and allocate resources. Leaders empower\nsubordinates by giving them the necessary resources, authority, and clear intent for success. Subordinates\nshould dutifully accept assigned responsibility, take initiative and accept risk within the limits of their\nauthority, and make disciplined use of the resources entrusted to their care. People value opportunities to be\nresponsible for their own work, be creative, and be respected for their abilities. Leaders apply judgment about\nwhen to step aside to let subordinates accomplish a mission. Leaders continually develop subordinates so\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 5-5",
            "Chapter 5\nthey are ready to accept ever increasing delegated responsibilities. Empowering others is a forceful statement\nof trust and one of the best ways of developing subordinates as leaders.\n5-33. General Eisenhower\u2019s D-Day statement to the Soldiers, sailors, and airmen (see figure 5-1) is an\nexample of how to provide purpose, direction, and motivation.\nFigure 5-1. General Eisenhower\u2019s D-Day statement\nUPHOLDING STANDARDS\n5-34. Standards provide a mark for performance to assess execution of tasks, as well as compliance with\nestablished policy and law. Standards are formal, detailed instructions\u2014observable, measurable, and\nachievable. Standards and discipline are the point of departure for leading Army organizations. Leaders must\nenforce Army standards, establish appropriate standards congruent with the Army Ethic where no standards\ncurrently exist, and ensure that subordinates understand and adhere to the standards.\n5-35. When upholding standards, leaders must be sensitive to the reality that not everything can be a number\none priority. In practice, leaders establish priorities because it is impossible to accomplish everything at once.\nA leader\u2019s ultimate goal is to train to the standards that ensure mission success; all other matters that consume\nsignificant time are of secondary importance. To be successful, leaders use the Army training management\n5-6 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Leads\nprocess to prepare the organization to meet standards by setting appropriate training goals and to plan,\nresource, execute, and evaluate training accordingly.\nPerforming Checks and Inspections\n5-36. Thorough inspections ensure equipment is mission capable and subordinates are prepared to perform\ntheir assigned duties. Mission specific checks and inspections minimize the chances of neglect or oversight\nthat result in mission failure or needless casualties. Inspections give leaders a chance to recognize\nsubordinates preparedness or make on-the-spot corrections. Subordinates understand that units that routinely\nperform checks and inspections have established standards and enforce them. Learning to perform effective,\nefficient checks and inspections is a critical leadership skill. Checks and inspections are a fundamental part\nof caring for subordinates.\nInstilling Discipline\n5-37. Leaders who consistently enforce standards instill discipline that will payoff in critical situations. True\ndiscipline demands habitual and reasoned obedience. An effective leader instills discipline by training to\nstandard, using rewards and corrective actions judiciously, instilling confidence, building trust among team\nmembers, and ensuring they have the necessary technical and tactical expertise to perform their job. Some\nmay associate discipline only with regulations and the consequences for errors in judgment and conduct.\nHowever, it is important to understand that discipline is fundamentally about the manner in which leaders\npractice their profession. Discipline is the means by which leaders advance the standards that are the hallmark\nof good Army units and organizations.\nBALANCING MISSION AND WELFARE\n5-38. Having genuine concern for subordinate health and welfare generates motivation, inspiration, and\ninfluence\u2014it is the right thing for leaders to do. Army members will be more willing to go the extra mile for\nleaders whom they respect, and they are more likely to respect leaders who respect them. Sending Soldiers\nor DA Civilians into harm\u2019s way to accomplish missions is always in tension with the desire to take care of\npeople. Leaders display genuine concern by preparing subordinates through tough realistic training that\nprepares them for the hazards and dangers of combat.\nTaking Care of Subordinates\n5-39. Taking care of subordinates is a solemn responsibility. The Army\u2019s purpose demands individuals\nperform their duties even at risk to their lives. Preparing subordinates for combat is the most important leader\nduty. Preparation entails creating disciplined conditions for learning and growth and enforcing standards in\ntraining. Training must be rigorous and simulate mission conditions as much as possible while keeping safety\nin mind. Leaders use risk management to balance risk cost with mission benefits during training and\noperations (see ATP 5-19). Effective leaders also recognize the need to provide reasonable comforts to bolster\nmorale and maintain long-term operational effectiveness.\n5-40. Many leaders connect at a personal level with their subordinates, which helps leaders to anticipate and\nunderstand individual circumstances and needs. Leaders who take an interest in Soldier and DA Civilian\ndevelopment show they care about their subordinates. It ranges from ensuring a subordinate is given time\naway from the unit to attend Army schools to finding out about a person\u2019s personal interests. Leaders should\nprovide an adequate family support and readiness network to help families, while at home station or deployed,\nwhether military or civilian.\nIdentifying High Risk Behavior\n5-41. Leaders identify subordinates who exhibit high-risk behavior and take action to reduce it whenever\npossible. High-risk behavior is a behavioral pattern that intentionally or unintentionally increases an\nindividual\u2019s probability of negative consequences. Examples include driving under the influence, failing to\nwear proper protective equipment, criminal activity, or illegal use of drugs. Studies also suggest a direct link\nbetween increased life stressors and increased high-risk behavior, so knowing subordinates well enough to\nunderstand when they are under increased stress is important.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 5-7",
            "Chapter 5\n5-42. The Army regulates order and discipline through enforcement of statutes (such as the Uniform Code\nof Military Justice) and policy. Misconduct represents a conscious decision to accept both the risk associated\nwith a prohibited activity (such as riding a motorcycle without a helmet) and the risk of being caught while\nviolating the standard (the Army\u2019s helmet policy).\n5-43. A commander\u2019s primary responsibility is to ensure the readiness, health, morale, welfare, and\ndiscipline of the unit. Every leader and follower has a role in supporting that responsibility. Leaders must\nidentify at-risk subordinates and intervene to help them. Table 5-1 summarizes the competency leads others.\nTable 5-1. The competency LEADS OTHERS\nLeaders motivate, inspire, and influence others to take initiative, work toward a common purpose, accomplish\ncritical tasks, and achieve organizational objectives.

Trust enables the ability of leaders to influence subordinates and effective command and control. Trust\nencompasses reliance upon others, confidence in their abilities, and consistency in behavior. People naturally\naccept the influence of people they trust. When high levels of trust exist among members of an organization,\nits members are more likely to influence each other up and down the chain of command and laterally with\nother organizations. Trust increases readiness and is essential for developing the shared understanding of\nintent that facilitates initiative by everyone within the organization. Trust builds over time through mutual\nrespect, shared understanding, and common experiences. Communication contributes to trust by keeping\nothers informed, establishing expectations, providing feedback, and developing commitment. Sustaining trust\ndepends on meeting expectations and commitments. Leaders and subordinates all contribute to the level of\ntrust that occurs in a unit. Leaders and subordinates earn or lose trust through everyday actions and attitudes.\n5-45. Importantly, leaders should promote a culture and climate of trust. Teams develop trust through\ncooperation, identification with other members, and contribution to the team effort. Leaders build trust with\ntheir followers and those outside the organization by practicing the leadership competencies and\ndemonstrating character, presence, and intellect. Leaders need to be competent, of good character, and fair\nand reliable to generate trust.\n5-46. Leaders who commit to coaching, counseling, and mentoring subordinates build relationships that\nfoster trust. These relationships built on trust enable leaders to empower subordinates, encourage initiative,\n5-8 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Leads\nreinforce accountability, and allow for open communication. Further, these relationships establish\npredictability and cohesion within the team.\n5-47. Failure to cultivate a climate of trust or a willingness to tolerate discrimination or harassment on any\nbasis erodes unit cohesion and breaks the trust subordinates have for their leaders. Counterproductive\nleadership such as favoritism, personal biases, unethical behavior, and poor communication often creates\nsuspicion, doubt, and distrust. Restoring broken trust is not a simple process, requiring situational awareness\nand significant effort on the part of all affected. Table 5-2 summarizes the competency builds trust.\nTable 5-2.

Extending influence beyond the chain of command is an essential leader competency. While Army\nleaders exert influence within their established chains of command, leaders must also be capable of extending\ninfluence to others beyond the chain of command. Extending influence beyond the chain of command is\ncritical to achieving success in unified action. Extending influence requires special awareness about how\ninfluence works in different groups and different situations.\n5-49. The key element of extending influence and building teams is creating a shared purpose among\nprospective team members. A unique aspect of extending influence is that those who a leader wishes to\ninfluence outside the unit may not recognize or willingly accept the authority of an Army leader. Often,\ninformal teams develop in situations where no official chains of authority exist. In some cases, this may\nrequire leaders to establish their credentials and capability for leading others. Credibility of a person or\norganization may stem from their appearance, conduct, or reputation. The ways Soldiers act and treat others\noutside the organization contribute to how others perceive the organization and the credibility of its leaders.\nLeaders ensure subordinates do not diminish the organization\u2019s credibility or esteem with external observers.\n5-50. When extending influence beyond the traditional chain of command, leaders often have to influence\nwithout authority designated or implied by rank and position. Civilian and military leaders often find\nthemselves in situations where they must task organize teams to accomplish missions. Leaders, especially\ncommanders, engage and communicate via multiple means (face-to-face, print media, broadcast media, social\nmedia, and other emerging collaboration technologies) to influence the perceptions, attitudes, sentiments,\nand behaviors of key actors and agencies. Leaders should personally engage key players to ensure audiences\nreceive messages as intended.\n5-51. Leading without formal authority requires adaptation to the conditions and cultural sensitivities of a\ngiven situation. Leaders require cultural knowledge to understand different social customs and belief systems\nand to address issues in those contexts. When conducting operations, for example, small-unit leaders must\nunderstand that their interaction with the local populace and their leaders can have dramatic effects on\nstrategic objectives. The manner in which a unit conducts house-to-house searches for enemy combatants\ncan influence the local population\u2019s acceptance of authority or become a recruiting incentive for the enemy.\nTable 5-3 summarizes the competency extends influence beyond the chain of command (see page 5-11).\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 5-9",
            "Chapter 5\nBUILDING TRUST OUTSIDE LINES OF AUTHORITY\n5-52. Forming effective, cohesive teams is often a leader\u2019s first challenge working outside a traditional\ncommand structure. These teams may form from disparate groups unfamiliar with military customs and\nculture. Successful teams develop an infectious winner\u2019s attitude. Problems are challenges rather than\nobstacles. Cohesive teams accomplish missions more efficiently than a loose group of individuals.\n5-53. Building coalitions is similar to building teams, but groups maintain generally greater independence\nin coalitions. Trust is a common ingredient in effective coalitions. Coalitions evolve by establishing contact\nwith others, building relationships, and identifying common interests. An effective strategy for breaking\ndown the barriers among smaller, subordinate group identities is to build or strengthen a common group\nidentity for all members, such as highlighting the common cause shared by all coalition partners.\n5-54. Training and working together builds collective competence, mutual trust, and promotes\ninteroperability. Mutual trust ultimately permeates the entire organization, embracing every member.\nBreakthrough at Chipyong-ni\nKorea\u2014February 1951\nThe 23d Infantry Combat Team, 2d Infantry Division, with attached French and Dutch\nunits, was moving forward to attack in advance of the Eighth Army. They were cut off\nand surrounded by overwhelming forces of Chinese Reds at Chipyong-ni in a narrow\nKorean valley. The Reds occupied the commanding ridges, while the American\ncommander, isolated far in advance of the general battle line, used a ring of lower hills\nwithin the valley itself for his defensive perimeter. For more than three days in near-\nfreezing weather, the defenders held their positions. On the fourth day, an American\narmored unit broke through from the south. The 23d Infantry Combat Team smashed\nout of the perimeter at the lower end of the valley to break the encirclement and\nrejoined the Eighth Army with its units and most equipment intact.\nGeneral Matthew B. Ridgway, in his official report to a Joint Session of Congress,\nstated, \"These American fighting men with their French comrades in arms measured\nup in every way to the battle conduct of the finest troops America or France has\nproduced throughout their national existence.\"\nUNDERSTANDING SPHERE, MEANS, AND LIMITS OF INFLUENCE\n5-55. When operating within an established command structure and common procedures, the provisions and\nlimits of roles and responsibilities are readily apparent. When leading outside an established organization,\nassessing the parties involved becomes another part of the operation. Identifying who is who, what role they\nhave, over whom they have authority or influence, and how they are likely to respond to the Army leader\u2019s\ninfluence are important considerations. Sometimes this is viewed as understanding the limits to the Army\u2019s\nor the leader\u2019s influence.\n5-56. Spanning the boundaries of disparate groups or organizations requires special attention. A key to\nextending influence outside the chain of command is learning about those organizations. By understanding\ntheir interests and desires, the leader will know what methods of influence are most likely to work.\nNEGOTIATING, BUILDING CONSENSUS, AND RESOLVING CONFLICTS\n5-57. Leaders must often resolve conflicts. One method is negotiation. Negotiation is a problem-solving\nprocess in which two or more parties discuss and seek to satisfy their interests on various issues through joint\ndecisions. The desired end state of the negotiation process is creation of a suitable choice between a clear,\nrealistic, and satisfactory commitment and a reasonable alternative to a negotiated agreement that better meets\nthe leader\u2019s interests. Interests relate to each party\u2019s needs, fears, concerns, goals, and motivations. Parties\u2019\ninterests may be shared, different, or in conflict. Effective leaders negotiate around interests rather than\npositions that tend to be static and unyielding.\n5-10 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Leads\n5-58. Leaders often must use negotiation skills to obtain the cooperation and support necessary to accomplish\na mission beyond the traditional chain of command. During complex operations, different unified action\npartners might operate under constraints of their national or organizational chains. This can result in\nimportant negotiations and conflict resolution versus a simpler process of issuing binding orders.\n5-59. Successful negotiation, employing a joint problem-solving approach, involves building effective\nrelationships, establishing two-way communication, understanding positions to clarify interests, creating\npossible solutions, using fair standards, and creating a sensible choice from firm, clear commitments, and\nrealistic alternatives. Credible negotiators test their assumptions, measure success appropriately for a given\nsituation, systematically prepare, make deliberate process-oriented decisions in conducting negotiations, and\nthoroughly review interactions.\n5-60. Not all partnerships are enduring. Some are intended only for a limited time. Others are expected to\nlast until a specific end state has been achieved. Leaders look ahead, anticipating future scenarios and the\nconditions under which a partnership will or should dissolve. They help define roles and responsibilities for\nelements of a post-alliance state to ensure a smooth transition process and set conditions so the desired end\nstate persists after the partnership has ended.\n5-61. Successful negotiations involve several activities. Leaders should\u2014\n\uf06c Understand and be willing to challenge assumptions about all parties involved, the desired\noutcome, the situation, and the negotiation itself.\n\uf06c Consider the measures of success for negotiation and choose the correct one for the situation.\n\uf06c Prepare thoroughly in a manner that supports the desired outcome and process for negotiation.\n\uf06c Build effective working relationships based on genuine rapport, respect, and reputation. Separate\nrelationship issues from substantive issues and address both on their own merits.\n\uf06c Use meaningful communication among involved parties to inquire, acknowledge, and advocate\nby demonstrating active listening and understanding while shaping perceptions and emotions of\nall parties.\n\uf06c Generate many options or creative solutions that meet the interests of all parties as well as possible.\nCreating options should be separate from evaluating and deciding.\n\uf06c Use objective, balanced, and fair criteria, standards, and merit to evaluate options. Apply a\nreciprocity test: would one party find this aspect fair if they proposed it?\n\uf06c Determine alternatives to a negotiated agreement. Alternatives are ways that each party can meet\ntheir interests without creating an agreement in the current negotiation. What is the best alternative\nto a negotiated agreement for each party?\n\uf06c Commit to an agreement only if it is better than alternatives, is the best option, and meets interests\nbased on fair criteria. A commitment should be clearly defined, well planned, and reasonable to\nimplement. Leaders must not promise what they cannot or will not deliver just to reach an\nagreement.\n\uf06c Review each negotiation systematically and use lessons to learn from one interaction to the next.\nTable 5-3. The competency EXTENDS INFLUENCE BEYOND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND\nLeaders need to influence beyond their direct lines of authority and beyond chains of command to include\nunified action partners.

Leaders are a product of their experiences. What leaders see others do forms their expectations for\ndecisions and actions. Leaders who intentionally live by the Army Values and the Warrior Ethos will\nconsistently display the character and actions that set a positive example. They put the organization and\nsubordinates above personal self-interest, career, and comfort. For the Army leader, it requires putting the\nlives of others above a personal desire for self-preservation.\nLeading with Confidence in Adverse Conditions\n5-63. A leader who projects confidence is an inspiration to others. Subordinates will follow leaders who are\ncompetent and comfortable with their own abilities. Leaders who understand their own abilities can gain\ngreater respect from their subordinates for their honesty, even as they seek to improve.\n5-64. Displaying confidence and composure when situations are not going well can be a challenge for\nanyone, but is important for the leader trying to lead others through challenging, stressful, and ambiguous\nsituations. Calm determination reflects confidence and is a key component of leader presence. A leader who\nshows hesitation or panic in the face of setbacks can trigger a chain reaction among others. A leader who is\nover-confident in difficult situations may lack the proper degree of care or concern, and risks being viewed\nas not understanding the seriousness of the problems at hand.\n5-65. Leading with confidence requires a heightened self-awareness and ability to master one\u2019s emotions.\nRegardless of the situation, developing the ability to remain confident involves\u2014\n\uf06c Having prior opportunities to experience one\u2019s reactions to adverse, high-pressure situations.\n\uf06c Maintaining a positive outlook when a situation becomes confusing or changes.\n\uf06c Remaining decisive after making or realizing mistakes.\n\uf06c Encouraging others when they show signs of weakness.\nDisplaying Courage\n5-66. Projecting confidence in combat and other dangerous situations requires physical and moral courage.\nWhile physical courage allows Soldiers to face mortal risks to life and limb, moral courage empowers leaders\nto stand firm on values, principles, and convictions. Leaders who take responsibility for their decisions and\nactions display moral courage. Morally courageous leaders critically look at themselves, consider new ideas,\nand implement change when needed.\n5-67. Moral courage in daily operations is as important as physical courage in combat. Consider a DA\nCivilian test board director who has the responsibility to determine whether a new piece of military equipment\nperforms to established specifications. Knowing that a failed test may cause the possibility of personal\npressure and command resistance from the program management office, a morally courageous tester will be\nprepared to endure that pressure and remain objective and fair in test procedures and conclusions. Moral\ncourage is fundamental to living the Army Values of integrity and honor, for all civilian or military members.\nDEMONSTRATING COMPETENCE\n5-68. Having the appropriate levels of expertise is vital to competent leaders who display confidence through\ntheir attitudes, actions, and words.

Table 5-5 summarizes the competency communicates (see page 5-16).\nLISTENING ACTIVELY\n5-71. An important part of effective two-way communication is active listening. Although the most\nimportant purpose of listening is to comprehend the sender\u2019s message, listeners should provide an occasional\nindication to the speaker that they are attentive, such as a head nod when face-to-face or stating \u201croger\u201d when\nusing radio or telephonic communication. Active listening involves avoiding interruption and keeping mental\nor written notes (when possible) of important points or items for clarification. Good listeners will understand\nthe message being sent in terms of its content, urgency, and the emotion with which it is communicated.\n5-72. Leaders should remain aware of barriers to listening that prevent hearing and absorbing what speakers\nsay. Avoid formulating a response before hearing what the person says. Avoid distraction by anger,\ndisagreement with the speaker, or other things that impede focusing on the message itself.\nCREATE SHARED UNDERSTANDING\n5-73. Competent leaders know themselves, the mission, and the message. They owe their organizations and\nsubordinates information that directly applies to their duties, providing context, and purpose. Sharing\ninformation contributes to shared understanding. Additionally, sharing information prepares subordinates for\nfuture duties and greater responsibility.\n5-74. When leaders keep their organizations informed, they build trust. Shared information contributes to\nreduced stress and controls rumors. Timely information exchange allows team members to determine\nrequirements and adjust to changing circumstances. Informing subordinates of a decision and the supporting\nreasons shows respect and conveys the need for their support and input. Good information flow ensures the\nnext leader in the chain is sufficiently prepared to take over, if required.\n5-75. Leaders use a variety of means to share information: face-to-face talks, written and verbal orders,\nrunning estimates and plans, published memos, white board sketches, briefings, email, websites, social\nmedia, and newsletters. To create shared understanding, a leader must acknowledge two critical factors:\n\uf06c A leader is responsible for making sure the team understands what is communicated.\n\uf06c A leader must consider informing elements outside the formal chain of command.\n5-76. Any means other than face-to-face communication present some risk for misunderstanding due to the\nlack of verbal and non-verbal cues. Building rapport and trust is an ongoing, long-term effort that occurs\nduring unit formation, individual unit reception, day-to-day garrison operations, and training exercises. It\ncontinues during operational missions. Learning what key leaders and staff mean when they say or write\nsomething is key to creating a basis for shared understanding. Taking adequate time to communicate when\nforming relationships is important to setting the right conditions, as are brief backs to confirm intent.\nSpeaking candidly and asking for clarification when necessary are important steps in creating shared\nunderstanding. Email, websites, and social media have increased the volume and speed of available\ninformation. However, they minimize verbal cues and lack the non-verbal cues that are vital to clear\ncommunications and shared understanding between people. Leaders need to guard against over-reliance upon\nelectronic means to communicate with each other and with subordinates. Leaders should use face-to-face\ncommunications with subordinates as much as possible to ensure understanding and to observe the feedback\ncues given by listeners.\n5-77. Communication also flows from bottom to top. Leaders find out what their people are thinking, saying,\nand doing by listening. Effective leaders observe their organizations by circulating among their followers to\ncoach, listen, and clarify. They pass relevant observations to enable planning and decision-making.\n5-78. To lead an organization effectively, leaders must determine how to reach their superiors when\nnecessary and to build relationships of mutual trust upward. Leaders assess how their direct leader\ncommunicates and prefers to receive information. Some use direct and personal contact while others may be\nmore comfortable with weekly meetings, email, or memoranda. Knowing the leader\u2019s intent, priorities, and\nthought processes improves the likelihood of effective communication. A leader who communicates well\nminimizes friction and improves the overall organizational climate.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 5-15",
            "Chapter 5\n5-79. To prepare organizations for inevitable communication challenges, leaders may create situations that\ntrain subordinates to act with minimal guidance or only the commander\u2019s intent. Leaders provide formal or\ninformal feedback to highlight things subordinates did well, what they could have done better, and what they\nshould do differently next time to improve information sharing and processing.\n5-80. Open communication does more than share information. It shows leaders care about those they work\nwith on a daily basis. Competent and confident leaders encourage open dialogue, listen actively to all\nperspectives, and ensure others can voice honest opinions without fearing negative consequences.\nTable 5-5. The competency COMMUNICATES\nLeaders communicate effectively by clearly expressing ideas and actively listening to others.

            "Chapter 6\nDevelops\nThe commander must assure each of his officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers,\nthe opportunity to improve military proficiency and to prepare mentally and physically for\nbattle. Every unit commander of the US Army is responsible for the progressive\nprofessional development of every soldier in his command.\nFM 100-5 (1976)\nDEVELOPS LEADERS\n6-1. Military leadership is unique because the armed forces develop and select their own leaders. The\nresponsibilities of Army members change as they assume new leadership positions. To ensure the quality of\nour leaders and future leaders does not diminish, all Army Soldiers and DA civilians have a responsibility to\ndevelop themselves and their subordinates. In Army leadership, there are four competencies in the category\nof develops that leaders consider while preparing themselves and their subordinates. A leader\u2014\n\uf06c Prepares self to encourage improvement in leading and other areas of leader responsibility.\n\uf06c Creates a positive environment and inspires an organization\u2019s climate and culture.\n\uf06c Develop others to assume greater responsibility or achieve higher expertise.\n\uf06c Stewards the profession to maintain professional standards and effective capabilities for the future.\n6-2. Leaders develop their own leadership proficiency through deliberate study, feedback, and practice.\nFundamentally, leadership develops when an individual desires to improve and invests effort, their superior\nsupports development, and the organizational climate values learning. Learning to be a leader requires\nknowledge of leadership, experience using this knowledge, and feedback from one\u2019s seniors, peers, and\nsubordinates. It also requires opportunities to practice leading others as often as possible. Formal systems\nsuch as evaluation reports, academic evaluation reports, and 360 assessments offer learning opportunities,\nbut the individual must embrace the opportunity and internalize the information. The fastest learning occurs\nwhen multiple challenging and interesting opportunities to practice leadership with meaningful and honest\nfeedback are present. These elements contribute to self-development, developing others, and setting a climate\nconducive to learning.\n6-3. Leader development of others involves recruiting, accessing, developing, assigning, promoting, and\nretaining the leaders with the potential for levels of greater responsibility. Leaders develop subordinates when\nthey prepare and then challenge them with greater responsibility, authority, and accountability. It is the\nindividual professional responsibility of all leaders to develop their subordinates as leaders.\n6-4. Successful leader development is based on five tenets (see FM 6-22):\n\uf06c Strong commitment by the Army, superiors, and individuals to leader development.\n\uf06c Clear purpose for what, when, and how to develop leadership.\n\uf06c Supportive relationships and culture of learning.\n\uf06c Three mutually supportive domains (institutional, operational, and self-development) that enable\neducation, training, and experience.\n\uf06c Providing, accepting, and acting upon candid assessment and feedback.\n6-5. Committed leaders continuously improve their organization, leaving it better than they found it. They\nexpect other leaders to do the same. Leaders look ahead and prepare subordinates with potential to assume\npositions with greater leadership responsibility; in turn, subordinates develop themselves to prepare for future\nleadership assignments. Leaders ensure subordinates know that those who are best prepared for increased\nresponsibility are those they are most likely to select for higher leadership positions.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 6-1",
            "Chapter 6\n6-6. Army leaders set priorities and weigh competing demands to balance individual and unit goals over\nvarious timeframes. They carefully steer their organizations\u2019 efforts to develop toward both short- and long-\nterm goals, while continuing to meet immediate requirements. Competing demands that vie for an\norganization\u2019s resources complicate a leader\u2019s work. Guidance from higher headquarters may help, but\nleaders have to make the tough calls to maintain a healthy balance.\nPREPARES SELF\n6-7. Leader preparation begins with self-awareness about one\u2019s strengths and limitations, followed by\nfocused self-development. Leaders maintain self-discipline, physical fitness, and mental well-being. They\ncontinue to improve their technical, tactical, and leadership expertise. Acquiring the necessary leadership\nskills to be successful is challenging and critical. In no other profession is the cost of being unprepared to\nlead so unforgiving in terms of mission failure and loss of life.\n6-8. Self-development is continuous and begins with the motivated individual, supplemented by a concerted\nteam effort. Part of that team effort is quality feedback from multiple sources, including peers, subordinates,\nand superiors to establish self-development goals and self-improvement courses of action. These improve\nperformance by enhancing previously acquired skills, knowledge, behaviors, and experience. Mentorship can\nfocus self-development efforts to achieve professional objectives. Table 6-1 summarizes the competency\nprepares self (see page 6-4).\nBEING PREPARED FOR EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES\n6-9. Successful self-development concentrates on the key attributes of the leader: character, presence, and\nintellect. While refining abilities to apply and model the Army Values, Army leaders maintain high levels of\nfitness and health, not only to set the example and earn the respect of others, but also to withstand the stresses\nof leading and maintaining their ability to think clearly. Leaders must exploit every available opportunity to\nsharpen their intellectual capacity and relevant knowledge. A developed intellect enables the leader to think\ncreatively and reason analytically, critically, ethically, and with cultural sensitivity.\n6-10. When faced with diverse operational settings, leaders draw on their intellectual capacity, critical and\ncreative thinking abilities, and applicable expertise. Leaders create these capabilities by studying doctrine\nand putting the information into context with personal experiences, military history, and geopolitical\nawareness. Self-development should include learning languages, the operational environment, military\ntheory, and tactics, techniques, and procedures of potential adversaries. A broad and continuous approach to\nlearning lessens the chances that a leader will face a completely unfamiliar situation, no matter how\nunexpected.\n6-11. Civilian and military education is an important part of professional development. Leaders should seek\nout further education and training opportunities beyond what the Army requires; doing so reflects the\nintellectual curiosity that the most effective leaders understand being prepared for the unexpected situations\nthey may face. As leaders assume levels of greater responsibility, the problems they face and decisions they\nmake become more complex. This requires that they become life-long learners and develop a keen sense of\nself-awareness. Leaders who assume they already know everything they need to know set themselves and\ntheir organizations up for failure.\nEXPANDING KNOWLEDGE\n6-12. Leaders read about, write about, and practice their profession. They prepare themselves for leadership\npositions through lifelong learning and broadening experiences relevant to their career paths. Lifelong\nlearning involves study to acquire new knowledge, reflection, and understanding about how to apply it when\nneeded. Broadening consists of those education and training opportunities, assignments, and experiences that\nprovide exposure outside the leader\u2019s narrow branch or functional area competencies. Broadening should be\ncomplementary to a leader\u2019s experience, and should provide wider perspectives that prepare the leader for\ngreater levels of responsibility.\n6-13. Some are fast learners; others must work harder to learn. Becoming a better learner involves\u2014\n6-2 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",

As a critical element of adaptability, self-awareness enables leaders to recognize their strengths and\nweaknesses across a range of conditions and progressively employ strengths to correct weaknesses.\nAwareness of weaknesses also helps leaders rely on others who possess strengths the leader may lack. To be\nself-aware, leaders must be able to formulate accurate self-perceptions, gather feedback from others, and\nchange their self-concept as appropriate. Being self-aware ultimately requires leaders to develop a clear,\nhonest picture of their capabilities and limitations.\n6-15. Leaders develop self-awareness though self-critique and self-regulation. Self-aware leaders are open\nto feedback from others and actively seek it. They possess the humility to ask themselves hard questions\nabout their performance, decisions, and judgment. They are serious about examining their own behavior to\ndetermine how to be a better, more effective leader. Self-aware leaders are reflective, hold themselves to\nhigher standards than their subordinates, and look to themselves first when subordinates are unsuccessful.\nSelf-aware leaders use others\u2019 strengths to offset their professional shortcomings and are willing to learn\nfrom others. Being self-aware ultimately requires leaders to develop a clear, honest picture of their own\ncapabilities and limitations.\n6-16. Self-aware leaders understand they are a component of a larger organization that demands both\nadaptability and humility. They understand the importance of flexibility because conditions continuously\nchange. They also understand that the focus is on the mission, not them. Subordinates see leaders who lack\nself-awareness as arrogant or disconnected. They may be technically competent but lack awareness as to how\nothers see them. This may obstruct their readiness to learn and ability to adapt. Lacking awareness can keep\nthem from creating a positive, learning work climate. Self-aware leaders sense how others react to their\nactions, decisions, and example.\n6-17. Competent and confident leaders make sense of their experience and use it to learn more about\nthemselves. Journals and after action reviews (AARs) are valuable tools in gaining an understanding of one\u2019s\nexperiences and reactions to changes in conditions. Self-critique can be as simple as posing questions about\none\u2019s own behavior, knowledge, or feelings or as formal as using a structured set of questions about an event.\nCritical questions include\u2014\n\uf06c What happened?\n\uf06c How did I react?\n\uf06c How did others react and why?\n\uf06c What did I learn about myself based on what I did and how I felt?\n\uf06c How will I apply what I learned?\n6-18. In rapidly changing conditions, self-awareness is a critical factor in making accurate assessments of\nchanges and a leader\u2019s personal capabilities and limitations to operate in those conditions. Self-awareness\nallows leaders to translate prior training to new conditions and seek the information they need to adapt. Self-\naware leaders are more responsive to situational and interpersonal cues regarding actions to take. They are\nbetter informed and able to determine what assistance to seek to handle a given situation.\n6-19. Adjusting one\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and actions without prompting from others is self-regulation.\nSoldiers and DA Civilians self-regulate when they realize that their actions fall short of the standards they\nhave for themselves and take the initiative to close the gap. Leaders who self-regulate have an advantage\nover those who do not.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 6-3",

Approachable leaders show respect for others'\nopinions, even if contrary or non-doctrinal. To be approachable, leaders remain objective when receiving bad\nnews and encourage subordinates to be open and candid in their communication.\n6-21. Culture and climate describe the conditions in which a leader leads. Leaders have direct and indirect\neffects on culture and climate. Culture refers to the environment of the Army as an institution and of major\nelements or communities within it. All leaders affect the climate at their respective echelon, which may\neventually affect the Army\u2019s culture.\n6-22. Culture is a longer lasting and more complex set of shared expectations than climate. Culture consists\nof shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterize the larger institution over time. The Army\u2019s\nculture is deeply rooted in tradition. Leaders refer to Army\u2019s culture to impress on Army personnel that they\nare part of something bigger than themselves. Soldiers and DA Civilians uphold the Army\u2019s culture to honor\nthose who have gone before and those who will come after.\n6-23. Climate is a shorter-term experience than culture and reflects how people think and feel about their\norganization. Climate depends upon a network of personalities within a unit that changes as Army personnel\ncome and go. A unit\u2019s climate, based on shared perceptions and attitudes, affects mutual trust, cohesion, and\ncommitment to the mission. A positive climate ensures Soldiers and DA Civilians are engaged and energized\nby their duties, work together as teams, and show respect for each other.\n6-24. A healthy Army culture and organizational climate will exhibit six overarching characteristics (see\nAR 600-100 ):\n\uf06c The Army culture and unit climate foster unity, cohesion, and trust.\n\uf06c The culture promotes and rewards mental agility, the ability to break from established paradigms,\nrecognize new patterns or circumstances, and adopt new solutions to problems.\n\uf06c The Army supports the selection of leaders and rewards members who demonstrate the ability to\nsense and understand the environment quickly to exploit fleeting opportunities or counter\nunexpected threats.\n\uf06c The Army requires and rewards delegation of authority on the part of leaders, and the\nunderstanding and prompt, thorough execution of leader\u2019s intent (two levels up) by subordinates.\n\uf06c The Army selects and rewards leaders who provide clear priorities and focus their unit\u2019s time and\norganizational energy on their mission.\n\uf06c The Army culture is one of inclusion that demands diversity of knowledge and perspectives to\naccomplish missions ethically, effectively, and efficiently.\nESTABLISHING A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n6-25. Leaders make it a point to dialogue with subordinates about the conditions of their lives and the unit\nto get a sense of the climate. Communicating goals openly provides subordinates a clear vision to achieve.\nCommunication between subordinates and leaders is essential to achieve and maintain a positive climate.\nLeaders inspire and motivate subordinates to bring creative and innovative ideas forward and they seek\nfeedback from subordinates about the climate. Openly taking part in unit events and activities increases the\nlikelihood that subordinates perceive leaders are concerned about the group\u2019s welfare and has the group\u2019s\nbest interests at heart.\n6-26. Leaders are ethical standard-bearers for the organization, responsible for establishing and maintaining\na professional climate wherein all are expected to live by and uphold the Army Values. Other staff\nspecialists\u2014the chaplain, staff judge advocate, inspector general, and equal employment opportunity\nspecialist\u2014assist leaders and assess the organization\u2019s climate. Regardless of available expert assistance, the\nultimate responsibility to create and maintain an ethical climate rests with the leader.\n6-27. Setting the right example does not necessarily mean subordinates will follow it. Some may feel that\ncircumstances justify misconduct. Therefore, leaders must monitor the organization\u2019s ethical climate and take\nprompt action to correct any discrepancies. It is important for subordinates to have confidence in the\norganization\u2019s ethical environment because much of what is necessary in combat conflicts with societal\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 6-5",
            "Chapter 6\nvalues that individuals bring into the Army. Strong commitment to the Army Values, Army Ethic, and\nWarrior Ethos by the commander fosters a unit\u2019s ethical climate.\n6-28. Leaders need to continually assess the organizational climate, realize the importance of development,\nand work to limit any zero-defect mentality. Recognizing the importance of long-term sustainability and\nsharing and encouraging feedback (both positive and negative) should be a priority for all team members.\nLeaders create positive climates by treating all fairly, maintaining open and candid communications between\nother leaders and subordinates, and creating and supporting learning environments.\nASSESSING ENVIRONMENT\n6-29. Leader behavior signals to every member of the organization what is and is not tolerated. The\nmembers\u2019 collective sense of the group\u2014its organizational climate\u2014is influenced by the leader\u2019s values,\nskills, and actions. Leaders must continuously assess the state of their organizational climates. Feedback from\nclimate assessments (see AR 600-20 and AR 600-100) assist leaders in this effort.\n6-30. To accurately assess organizational climates, leaders can develop a focused plan of action as follows\u2014\n\uf06c Assess the unit. Observe those in the unit, gather feedback, and conduct focus group sessions of\nthe workplace. Chaplains may assist with ethical climate assessment through informal means or\nby use of ethical climate assessment surveys (see GTA 22-06-001).\n\uf06c Analyze gathered information to identify what needs improvement. After identifying what needs\nimprovement, begin developing courses of action for improvements.\n\uf06c Select a plan of action to correct identified weaknesses. Gather important information, assess\nlimitations and risks associated with the various courses, identify available key personnel and\nresources, and verify facts and assumptions. Attempt to predict outcomes for each possible course\nof action. Based on predictions, select several leader actions to address target issues.\n\uf06c Execute the plan of action by educating, training, or counseling subordinates; instituting new\npolicies or procedures; and revising or enforcing proper systems of rewards and punishment.\nPeriodically reassess the chosen actions.\nBUILDING TRUST AND COHESION\n6-31. Trust and cohesion are characteristics of the Army culture that have direct impacts on climate. Leaders\nencourage subordinates to work together for the greater good while promoting pride in organizational\naccomplishments. Subordinates trust leaders who underwrite their good faith efforts to act in accordance with\ntheir leaders' intents. If the outcome is not what the leader expects, the leader and subordinate discuss the\nproblem and develop a strategy to get back on track.\n6-32. Trust also follows when a team appreciates a concerted, honest effort even when the results are\nincomplete. Army members gain confidence in leaders who enable them to achieve standards and demand\nquality performance. Leaders build cohesive teams by setting and maintaining a collective mindset among\nteam members and enabling successful performance.\n6-33. Conflict occurs when people disagree about ideas or feel their interests are threatened. Conflict does\nnot require the involvement of two people, nor is it necessarily based on facts. One person may be in conflict\nwith another, without the second person realizing it or being at fault. Leaders should identify and resolve\nconflict before it affects personal and organizational functioning, good order and discipline, and cohesion.\n6-34. Leaders should be able to resolve two kinds of conflicts: work-related and personal. Any given conflict\nis likely to contain some level of both elements. Work-related conflict can stem from disagreement over a\ncourse of action, workload perceptions, or the best steps for completing a specific task. Personal conflicts\ngenerally stem from people who do not like or respect each other or some perceived grievance based upon\nindividual behavior. Leaders need to develop the skills to address both types of conflicts as rapidly and\neffectively as possible. Conflicts that simmer lower the morale and duty performance of those involved and\ncan corrode an organizational cohesion when not quickly addressed.\n6-6 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Develops\nENCOURAGING INITIATIVE\n6-35. Encouraging subordinates to exercise initiative can be a significant challenge. Those who are not in\nleadership positions are sometimes reluctant to recognize when a situation calls for them to accept\nresponsibility and step forward. Climate largely shapes the degree to which unit members feel comfortable\nexhibiting initiative and providing input. Leaders create the conditions for initiative by guiding others in\nthinking through problems for themselves.\nDEMONSTRATING CARE FOR PEOPLE\n6-36. The nation entrusts the Army leader with its most precious commodity, its sons and daughters. Army\nleaders embrace this responsibility and keep the well-being of their subordinates and their families in mind.\nThere are times when leaders place their subordinates in harm\u2019s way; this is not because they do not care for\nthem, but because they have a duty to the Nation. Leaders also care for subordinates by maintaining their\ntraining level so in the event of combat they are well prepared.\n6-37. Leaders who respect those with whom they work will likely garner respect in return. Simple actions\ncan demonstrate respect and care, such as listening patiently or addressing families\u2019 needs. Detecting change\nin morale and actively seeking honest feedback about the health of individuals and the organization indicate\ncare.\nESPRIT DE CORPS, TRADITION, AND HISTORY\n6-38. Historians describing great armies often focus on weapons, equipment, and training. They may mention\nadvantages in numbers or other factors easily analyzed, measured, and compared. However, many historians\nplace great emphasis on two factors not easily measured: esprit de corps and morale.\n6-39. Esprit de corps is a traditional military expression that denotes the collective camaraderie and cohesion\nwithin a unit. Morale is associated with an individual's sense of well-being\u2014mental, spiritual, and physical.\nEsprit de corps and individual morale are critical factors affecting mutual trust, cohesive teamwork, and the\ncommitment to persevere through adversity, challenges, and setbacks. Focus on customs, courtesies,\ntraditions, and reflection on the organization\u2019s history and accomplishments strengthen esprit de corps.\nWhether engaging enemy forces, establishing security for a lasting peace, or rebuilding a community\ndevastated by natural disaster, esprit de corps helps organizations overcome adversity and challenges.\nLeaders who demonstrate genuine concern for the welfare of their subordinates strengthen morale. However,\nleaders breed cynicism, compromise mutual trust, and degrade morale if they allow disconnects between\ntheir words and deeds to occur.\n6-40. Leaders who foster tradition and an awareness of history build camaraderie and unit cohesion,\nbecoming esprit de corps. Army members draw strength from knowing they are part of long-standing\ntradition. Many of the Army\u2019s everyday customs and traditions remind Soldiers they are the latest addition\nto a long line of Soldiers. The uniforms, official ceremonies, music, salutes, military titles, organizational\nhistory, and the Army Values are reminders of tradition. This sense of belonging lives in many veterans long\nafter they have left service. For many, service to the Nation remains the single most significant experience\nof their lives.\n6-41. Unit names such as the Big Red One, All American, Keystone Division, and Rainbow Division carry\nextensive histories and traditions. To sustain tradition, leaders pass on the history that surrounds unit crests,\nawards, decorations, and badges. Upholding traditions ensures the Army\u2019s culture becomes integral to every\nmember of the Army team.\n6-42.

The institutional domain includes\nArmy centers and schools that provide functional and professional military education such as Airborne school\nand the Army Management Staff College. The basic knowledge gleaned in the institutional Army develops\nfurther through the operational domain. The operational domain encompasses all activities that allow leaders\nto learn through experiences. Optimizing leader development in the operational domain requires a deliberate\napproach to leader progression in the context of training events and operational deployments, where leaders\napply what they learned from schools to a wide variety of situations and environments.

For instance, leaders discuss the significance of effective counseling with subordinates to help\nthem understand its impact in developing future leaders, achieving goals, managing expectations, and\nimproving organizations.\n6-47. Learning from experience is not always possible\u2014leaders cannot have every experience in training.\nTaking advantage of what others have learned provides benefits without having the personal experience.\nLeaders should share their experiences with subordinates through counseling, coaching, and mentoring\nsessions; for example, combat veterans can share experiences with Soldiers who have not been in combat.\nLeaders should also take the opportunity to write about their experiences, sharing their insights with others\nin professional journals or books.\nASSESSING DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS\n6-48. An important step in developing others is to understand which areas are already strong and which\nshould be stronger. Leaders who know their subordinates understand where to encourage development.\nLeaders observe new subordinates under different task conditions to identify strengths and weaknesses and\nto see how quickly they pick up new information and skills.\n6-49. Leaders continuously assess the developmental needs of their subordinates. They evaluate the\ncompetence of their subordinates. They assess whether someone can meet the expectations of a new position.\nThey review the organization\u2019s policies, status reports, and recent inspection results for indicators of weak\nareas. They ask outgoing leaders for an assessment and meet with key people outside the organization.\nEffective leaders periodically update their in-depth assessments since a thorough assessment enables gradual\nand systematic changes without causing damaging organizational turmoil.\n6-50. FM 6-22 provides indicators of leader performance and information on determining whether each\nattribute and competency is a strength, meeting standard, or a developmental need. To objectively assess\nsubordinates over time, leaders\u2014\n\uf06c Observe and record subordinates\u2019 performance in the core leader competencies.\n\uf06c Determine if their performances meet, exceed, or fall below expected standards.\n\uf06c Share observations with subordinates and provide an opportunity for them to comment.\n6-51. Leader development doctrine furnishes detailed information on assessing individual capabilities and\nexpanding them through feedback, study, and practice. FM 6-22 provides learning activities for all leader\nattributes and competencies. This information is useful whether a leader is developing self or others.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 6-9",
            "Chapter 6\nCOUNSELING, COACHING, AND MENTORING\n6-52. Leaders have three principal roles in developing others. They provide knowledge and feedback through\ncounseling, coaching, and mentoring. Providing feedback is a common element of interacting with others,\nregardless of developmental role or process. Feedback significantly contributes to development, accelerates\nlearning in day-to-day experiences, and translates into better performance. Providing feedback starts with\nobservation and accurate assessment of performance. Planning to make observations of a subordinate is the\nfirst step in feedback. The best observations occur when subordinates engage in critical performance, interact\nwith others, or address a challenging problem. Keeping observation notes is useful when tracking multiple\nsubordinates. Table 6-3 provides a concise comparison of each approach to development (see page 6-11).\nCounseling\n6-53. Counseling is central to leader development. Counseling is the process used by leaders to guide\nsubordinates to improve performance and develop their potential. Subordinates are active participants in the\ncounseling process. During counseling, leaders help subordinates to identify strengths and weaknesses and\ncreate plans of action. To make the plans work, leaders actively support their subordinates throughout the\nimplementation and assessment processes. Subordinates invest themselves in the process by being forthright\nin their willingness to improve and being candid in their assessment and goal setting. Counseling is an integral\npart of a comprehensive program to develop subordinates. With effective counseling, no evaluation report\u2014\npositive or negative\u2014should be a surprise. A counseling program includes all subordinates, not just those\nthought to have the most potential. See ATP 6-22.1 for more information on the counseling process.\nCoaching\n6-54. Coaching relies primarily on teaching and guiding to bring out and enhance capabilities already\npresent. Coaching is a development technique used for a skill, task, or specific behaviors. The coach helps\nthem understand their current level of performance and guides them to reach the next level of development.\nCoaches should possess considerable knowledge in the area in which they coach others.\n6-55. Coaches use all or some of the following approaches depending on the subordinate and situation:\n\uf06c Focus Goals: This requires the coach to identify the specific purpose of the coaching session. Both\nthe person being coached and the coach need to discuss expectations. The coach communicates to\nthe individual the developmental tasks for the coaching session, which can incorporate results of\nthe individual\u2019s 360-degree assessment and feedback report.\n\uf06c Clarify the Leader\u2019s Self-Awareness: The coach works directly with the individual to define both\nstrengths and developmental needs. During this session, the coach and the individual communicate\nperceived strengths, developmental needs, and focus areas to improve performance. Both the\ncoach and the individual agree on areas of developmental needs.\n\uf06c Uncover Potential: The coach facilitates self-awareness of the individual\u2019s potential and\ndevelopmental needs by guiding the discussion with questions. The coach actively listens to how\nthe individual perceives potential. The aim is to encourage the free flow of ideas. The coach also\nassesses the individual\u2019s readiness to change and incorporates this into the session.\n\uf06c Eliminate Developmental Barriers: The coach identifies developmental needs with the individual\nand areas that may hinder self-development. The coach helps the individual determine how to\novercome barriers to development and implement an effective plan to improve performance. The\ncoach helps identify potential sources of support for implementing an action plan.\n\uf06c Develop Action Plans: The coach and the individual develop an action plan defining actions that\ncan improve performance within a given period. The coach uses a developmental action guide to\ncommunicate those self-directed activities the individual can accomplish to improve performance\nin a particular competency.\n\uf06c Follow-Up: After the initial session, the coach should conduct a follow-up as part of a larger\ntransition. Additionally, participants should provide feedback concerning the effectiveness of the\nassessment, the usefulness of the information received, and progress made. Coaches provide\nfrequent informal feedback and timely, proactive, formal counseling to regularly inspire and\nimprove subordinates.\n6-10 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Develops\nMentoring\n6-56. Mentorship is the voluntary developmental relationship that exists between a person of greater\nexperience and a person of lesser experience that is characterized by mutual trust and respect (AR 600-100).\nThe following generally characterize mentorship:\n\uf06c Mentoring takes place when the mentor provides a less experienced leader with advice and counsel\nover time to aid professional and personal growth.\n\uf06c The developing leader often initiates the relationship and seeks counsel from the mentor. The\nmentor takes initiative to check on the well-being and development of the leader.\n\uf06c Mentorship affects personal development (maturity, interpersonal and communication skills) as\nwell as professional development (technical, tactical, and career path knowledge).\n\uf06c Mentorship empowers the Army to maintain a highly competent set of leaders.\n\uf06c The strength of a mentoring relationship relies on mutual trust and respect. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s carefully\nconsider assessment, feedback, and guidance; these become valuable for growth to occur.\n6-57. Mentoring relationships exist outside the superior\uf02dsubordinate relationship. Supportive mentoring\noccurs when a mentor does not outrank the person mentored, but has extensive knowledge and experience to\nshare. Mentoring relationships may occur between peers and between senior NCOs and junior officers; thus,\nmentoring can occur across many levels of rank. Civilian leaders and senior civilian subordinates can provide\na substantial mentorship resource for training and integration of military and civilian personnel. Often, this\nrelationship extends past the time where one party has left the other\u2019s chain of command.\n6-58. While many associate mentoring with improving duty-related performance and growth, mentoring may\ninclude a spiritual dimension. A chaplain or other spiritually trained individual may play a significant role in\nadvising individuals regarding spiritual issues to help clarify and develop personal and professional identity,\npurpose, motivation, and resiliency in adversity.\nTable 6-3.

            "Chapter 6\nOPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n6-59. Working in real settings\u2014solving real problems with actual team members\u2014provides challenges and\nconditions where leaders see the significance of leadership and practice their craft. Good leaders encourage\nsubordinates to develop in every aspect of daily activities and should seek to learn every day themselves. The\noperational domain includes the three factors of leader, led, and situation and provides real tasks with\nfeedback. This combination provides ideal conditions for development. Planning that includes identification\nand creation of learning opportunities for leaders promotes development. FM 6-22 provides techniques for\nhow to plan and ensure a mindset to develop leaders. Integrating leader development into the organization\ncreates a positive, learning climate, builds an expectation that leader development is a priority, and produces\nimproved individual and unit readiness.\n6-60. Good leaders seek ways to define duties to prepare subordinates for responsibilities in their current\nposition or next assignment. Assigning a leader to set up and control a firing range is an opportunity to coach\nthem on working with sister units and ways to train Soldiers. The DA Civilian intern program is another\nexample where duty performance is used for development. Leaders can rotate into special duty assignments\nto give them broad leadership experiences and be given stretch assignments or tasks to accelerate their\ndevelopment.\n6-61. Leaders are responsible for ensuring subordinates receive the appropriate education, training, and\nexperiences at the proper time for promotion as well as increasing their potential in current and future\nassignments. Self-development can occur anywhere, so it is also an important aspect of development in\norganizations. Individuals must be active participants in their developmental process. They must not wait for\na leader or mentor to choose them but have the responsibility to be proactive in their own development. Every\nArmy officer, NCO, Soldier, and DA Civilian should identify personal strengths and areas for improvement.\nEach individual should then determine a developmental plan. Some strategies to use in planning development\nare\u2014\n\uf06c Ask questions and pay attention to experts.\n\uf06c Read and study.\n\uf06c Observe those in leadership positions.\n\uf06c Find educational opportunities (civilian, military, and correspondence).\n\uf06c Seek and engage in new and varied opportunities.\nDEVELOPING TEAMS\n6-62. A team is any collection of people that functions together to perform a mission or collective task.\nTeams that work well have an advantage of increasing motivation and accountability among members.\nDeveloping close teams takes hard work, patience, and interpersonal skill on the part of the leader (see\nATP 6-22.6). Because high-functioning teams complete missions on time with given resources and a\nminimum of wasted effort, they are a worthwhile investment. In war and peace, cohesive teams, operating\nwith mutual trust, accomplish the missions more effectively than those lacking trust and cohesion. Hallmarks\nof cohesive teams include\u2014\n\uf06c Trusting each other and being able to predict what each will do.\n\uf06c Working together to accomplish the mission.\n\uf06c Executing tasks thoroughly and quickly.\n\uf06c Meeting and exceeding standards.\n\uf06c Adapting to demanding challenges.\n\uf06c Learning from their experiences and developing pride in accomplishments.\n6-63. Leaders must guide teams through three developmental stages: formation, enrichment, and\nsustainment. Leaders remain sensitive to the fact that teams develop differently and the boundaries between\nstages are not absolute. The results can determine what to expect of the team and what improves its\ncapabilities. Understanding the perspectives of team members is important. Leaders understand that the\nnational cause, mission, purpose, and many other concerns may not be relevant to the Soldier\u2019s perspective.\nRegardless of larger issues, Soldiers perform for others on the team, for the Soldier on their right or left. A\nfundamental truth is that Soldiers accomplish tasks because they do not want to let each other down.\n6-12 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Develops\nDeveloping close teams takes hard work, patience, and interpersonal skill on the part of the leader (see\nATP 6-22.6).\nFormation Stage\n6-64. Although Army leaders generally do not select most of their team members, they have the\nresponsibility to ensure their teams are high performing units. Teams work best when new members quickly\nfeel a part of the team. There are two critical steps of the formation stage: reception and orientation.\nReception\n6-65. Reception is the leader\u2019s welcome to new members of the organization. Time permitting, reception\nshould include a personal introduction. Initially, all new team members will be concerned about fitting in and\nbelonging. As teams receive new personnel, they try to diminish the uncertainty for the new team member.\nThis is a team responsibility, not just a leader\u2019s responsibility.\nOrientation\n6-66. Orientation begins with meeting other team members, learning the layout and schedule of the\nworkplace, and generally understanding conditions. In combat, leaders may not have much time to orient\nnew team members. Leaders pair new arrivals with more experienced Soldiers to help orient them.\n6-67. Leaders play a pivotal role in how a team forms and works together. During team formation, leaders\nassess skills and expertise present on the team and determine how to best apply them. Leaders provide\ndirection and reinforce the norms within the teams, and communicate performance standards.\nEnrichment Stage\n6-68. During the enrichment stage, teams strengthen relationships between members and focus on team\nobjectives. Members become accountable to and for the team. New members gradually move from\nquestioning everything to trusting themselves, their peers, and their leaders. Trusted team members are more\nwilling to resolve differences of opinion and fact, suspend doubt, and concentrate on duties and missions.\nLeaders learn to trust by listening, establishing clear lines of authority, and enforcing standards. Leaders\nshould understand indicators of distrust such as persistent defense of personal opinion, conflict avoidance,\nsuspicion about others\u2019 motivation, and ignoring the importance of team membership. Leaders improve trust\nand build morale by getting to know members, communicating truthfully, treating them fairly, and\nrecognizing good work and teamwork.\n6-69. Cohesion is the bond of relationships and motivational factors that help a team stay together. A\ncohesive team puts aside its differences and chooses to work together. Cohesive teams achieve greater\nsuccess, feeding a sense of greater team competence, commitment, and confidence. These factors increase\ncohesion and contribute to the willingness to undertake new challenges and overcome hardship.\nSustainment Stage\n6-70. During this stage, members identify as a \u201cteam.\u201d They own it, have pride in it, and want team success.\nThere is pride in knowing that individuals are part of a recognized organization: best squad, best tank crew,\nor best dining facility. Recognition elevates the professional status of the team members. While not all teams\ncan achieve this level of recognition, the team\u2019s attitude about its capabilities elevates motivation and the\ndesire to meet new challenges.\n6-71. Teams may encounter difficulties in the sustainment stage. Leaders watch for signs of complacency\nand intervene by reinforcing good interaction practices and holding the team to standard. Changes for which\nthe team is not prepared can be another challenge for the leader. Shared experiences and regular training\nallow teams to address unexpected changes in situations. Empowering the team to improve coordination and\nstanding operating procedures can strengthen its ability to handle change.\n6-72. Key responsibilities of the team leader in all stages of team building and teamwork include trust,\ncooperation, task commitment, accountability, and the work to be completed.

Table 7-1 summarizes the competency gets results (see\npage 7-3).\nPURPOSE\n7-2. A leader\u2019s primary purpose is to accomplish the mission. Leadership builds and guides the effective\norganizations necessary to do so. Leaders require a focus on the future that views building and maintaining\neffective organizations as critical to mission accomplishment. Building effective Army organizations serves\nthe larger purpose of mission accomplishment. Mission accomplishment takes priority over everything else,\nespecially in combat where their unit may be at risk of destruction.\n7-3.

Many matters consume a leader\u2019s time and attention. Leaders have obligations that are far ranging and\nat times are contradictory. Leaders make these challenges transparent to their subordinates whenever\npossible. Leaders are responsible to create conditions that enable subordinates to focus and accomplish\ncritical tasks. They do this by minimizing distractions and prioritizing what they need to accomplish within\nthe commander\u2019s intent. Leaders are responsible for anticipating the consequences of any action. Thorough\nplanning is beneficial, but anticipating second- and third-order effects requires imagination, vision, and an\nappreciation of other people, talents, and organizations.\n7-5. When communicating the mission, leaders provide clear guidance so subordinates and others\nunderstand the mission and their commander\u2019s intent. Leaders ensure tasks are within the capabilities of the\norganization and do not detract from the ability to accomplish the mission. If leaders are unable to deconflict\nthe friction between taskings, they should seek relief by approaching superiors with the impact on their\ncritical task and possible alternative courses of action.\n7-6. All leaders understand that change is inevitable. Army leaders prepare their organizations to adapt. It\ndoes not matter if the unit is on block leave, in a garrison support cycle, or in the most intense firefight.\nLeaders focus their subordinates on what they need to do to accomplish the mission. This allows subordinates\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 7-1",
            "Chapter 7\nto know where to place effort or what not to do. Leaders monitor their subordinates to ensure they are\nhandling the stress that a task or mission places on them. Even in the most mundane or dangerous situations,\nthere are opportunities to restore or build morale.\n7-7. All leaders have a responsibility to ensure resources are available and used wisely. Managing resources\nrequires different approaches and different skills. Resources can take the form of money, materiel, personnel,\nor time. Getting resources can be a relatively straightforward process, such as putting in an ammunition\nrequest through established support channels for an upcoming range. Other times, a leader may need to be\nmore creative and resourceful in securing resources for a complex task.\n7-8. Ultimately, a leader must decide how to best allocate resources to accomplish the mission. Leaders\nneed to deal openly and honestly with their allocation decisions and be prepared to handle reactions from\nthose who feel the leader handled their requests unfairly or ineffectively.\n7-9. When teams stress over high workloads, leaders should intervene to prioritize tasks and mitigate the\ncauses or symptoms of seemingly insurmountable workloads. As a preventive step, planning aids even\ndistribution of tasks\u2014mission prioritization allows followers to know where to place effort or what to delay\nor suspend. Other measures require leaders to shield or protect subordinates from excessive taskings when\npossible and to ensure appropriate resources are available. A long-term measure is to develop individuals and\ntrain teams through cross training to be capable of assuming high workload levels. Effective communications\nallows members to prepare themselves to handle greater levels of workload or handle the effects of stress\nthat the workload places on them. Morale-building activities, wellness and resilience steps, and granting\nbreaks from operational rigors when possible, can also help address stress. Successful organizations have\nleaders who understand workload levels and are proactive in mitigating stress or stressors.\n7-10. Many leaders struggle with delegation, from the newly promoted to the most experienced who simply\ntake on too much. Moving from an individual contributor to overseeing the efforts of others can be\nchallenging. It requires leaders to spend their time differently and develop different skill sets this includes\nbalancing workloads and avoiding overtasking subordinates. Some leaders may experience the opposite\nsituation by delegating too much. Some basic guidelines apply to all leaders:\n\uf06c Delegating improperly, or failing to delegate at all, leads to organizational failure.\n\uf06c A leader\u2019s role is to ensure the task is accomplished, not to complete the task personally.\n\uf06c While completing daily, weekly, and monthly planning and reflection, leaders ask, \u201cWhat am I\ndoing that I should delegate?\" \u201cWhat do I delegate that I should not?\u201d\n\uf06c Leaders cannot develop subordinates without delegating to them.\n\uf06c Leaders cannot adjust and expand their unit\u2019s capabilities without delegating.\nASSESSING, ADJUSTING, AND CONTINUING MISSION\n7-11. The ability to assess a situation accurately and reliably against desired outcomes, established values,\nand ethical standards is a key way for leaders to achieve consistent results and mission success. Assessment\noccurs continually during planning, preparation, and execution; it is not solely an after-the-fact evaluation.\nAccurate assessment requires instinct and intuition based on experience and learning. Accurate assessment\nrequires reliable and valid information. Leaders take action based on their assessments to reset or keep tasks\nand missions on track. Leaders periodically assess individual and organizational weaknesses to prevent\nmishaps and mission failure. Accurate assessment is essential to developing subordinate leadership, training\nmanagement, and initiating improvements.\n7-12. To accomplish missions consistently, leaders need to maintain motivation within the team. One of the\nbest ways to do this is to recognize and reward good performance. Leaders who recognize individual and\nteam accomplishments promote positive motivation and actions for the future. Recognizing individuals and\nteams in front of superiors and others gives those contributors an increased sense of worth. Leaders seek\nopportunities to recognize the performance of their subordinates. They do this by crediting their subordinates\nfor the work they do. Sharing credit has enormous payoffs in terms of building trust and teams.\n7-13. Army members take advantage of opportunities and encourage ideas to improve the performance of\nthemselves, subordinates, and their organizations. Leaders encourage a mindset that strives for increased\neffectiveness and efficiencies. Army members do the following to improve performance:\n7-2 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",

Leaders need to encourage ideas for improvement. Leaders should guard against discouraging ideas\nand encourage subordinates to present new ideas.

Contextual factors and operational challenges affect leaders, their subordinates, and accomplishment\nof the mission. This chapter builds upon the foundation of attributes and examines dynamic factors\u2014positive\nand negative\u2014that may arise when applying leadership across different areas and contexts.\n8-2. The nature of large-scale combat operations creates situations where leaders may send Soldiers and\nentire units into harm's way knowing they may not survive. Army leaders perform this solemn duty because\nwar demands nothing less than total commitment to accomplish the larger mission. The purpose, direction,\nand motivation Army leaders provide Soldiers and units is made in good faith that personal sacrifices serve\nthe greater good of the Army and the Nation.\nThird Battalion, 358th Infantry Regiment\nMahlman Line\u201410-12 July 1944\nThe officers and men displayed great courage, endurance, and dogged determination\nin the attack through the dense Foret de Mont Castre, France, against the position\nknown as the Mahlman Line, a part of the main enemy defensive line. It consisted of\ndug-in positions, cunningly camouflaged in the tangled underbrush, and other devices\nthat maximized the natural defensive qualities of the area. Despite repeated fierce\nenemy counterattacks, the battalion relentlessly drove forward and eliminated a\nbattalion of parachute infantry and a company of parachute engineers, both of which\nwere part of the elite 5th German Parachute Division. By the end of the first day, the\nbattalion commander and 11 of the 17 company officers were casualties, but the\nadvance had progressed to within 75 yards of the initial objective. The following day\nthe remnants of the three rifle companies (one had only 20 Soldiers), reorganized into\none composite company with a strength of 126 and commanded by a lieutenant. In a\nrenewed charge, the depleted battalion overran the objective, killed 40 enemy, and\ncaptured eight machine guns, bazookas, and mortars. As it left the forest, the\nconsolidated unit, retaining its aggressiveness, fought with exceptional daring and\ngreat skill to take successive objectives. The battalion\u2019s break-through of the enemy\u2019s\nmain position contributed materially to the division\u2019s advance. The inspiring leadership\nand gallantry displayed by all garnered the unit the Presidential Unit Citation.\nLEADERS AND COURAGE\n8-3. Army leaders accept the responsibility to develop and lead others to achieve results. All members of\nthe Army swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,\nforeign and domestic. This oath subordinates the military leader to the laws of the Nation and its elected and\nappointed leaders, creating a distinct civil-military relationship. Fulfilling that oath, leaders will face\u2014and\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 8-1",
            "Chapter 8\nhave to overcome\u2014fear, danger, and physical and moral adversity while caring for those they lead and\nprotecting the organization entrusted to them.\n8-4. Taking the initiative to make something happen requires more personal courage rather than standing\nby or withdrawing and hoping events will turn out well. Leaders require personal courage in many conditions:\nconfronting problems of discipline or disorderly conduct, leading Soldiers in harm's way, needing innovation\nor adaptation to do something never done before, being candid with a superior about a risky or improper\ncourse of action, deferring to a more technically competent subordinate, or freeing units and personnel to\nsolve problems. Leaders must have the courage to make tough calls, to discipline or demand better when\nrequired. Consistent and fair leaders will earn the respect of their followers.\nRemagen Bridgehead\nRemagen, Germany\u20147 March 1945\nOn the Ludendorf Bridge crossing the Rhine, Combat Command B, 9th Armored\nDivision\u2014headed by the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion\u2014with \"superb skill, daring,\nand esprit de corps\" successfully effected the first bridgehead across Germany's\nformidable river barrier and contributed decisively to the enemy\u2019s defeat. The 27th\nBattalion reached Remagen and found the bridge intact but mined for demolition.\nAlthough its destruction was imminent, without hesitation and in face of heavy fire,\ninfantrymen rushed across the structure and seized the surrounding high ground with\nenergy and skill. The entire episode illustrates a high degree of initiative, leadership,\nand gallantry toward which all armies strive but too rarely attain, and won the\nDistinguished Unit Citation.\n8-5. A self-aware leader will learn from each decision and action; with guidance from superiors, the leader\nwill grow in confidence. Resilient and fit leaders have the psychological and physical capacity to bounce\nback from life's stressors to thrive in an era of persistent conflict.\nLEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT\n8-6. Leadership and management both cover the actions to influence, motivate, provide purpose and give\ndirection to others, and to sustain and improve the organization. Both add order to situations by planning,\ncontrolling, coordinating human, and material resources and by communicating with and gaining\ncommitment from others. Management is complementary to leadership and applies to maintaining order,\nachieving efficiency, and complying with law. Processes, resources, and systems are things that leaders must\nmanage. Leaders manage personnel as an important resource, but they lead people as individuals and groups\nto accomplish missions. Management is one of the skills that leaders need more as the scope and scale of\ntheir responsibilities increase over the course of a career. Successful management requires understanding\nabout policy, regulations, and the procedural aspects of how an organization functions as part of a larger\norganization. The leader attributes and competencies apply to management as well as to leadership.\nADAPTABILITY AND VERSATILITY\n8-7. The Army recognizes that it faces highly adaptive enemies and operates within dynamic, ever-changing\nconditions. Sometimes conditions change suddenly and unexpectedly from a calm, relatively safe operation\nto a close combat situation. Other times conditions differ (such as day to night) and leaders adapt.\nAdaptability is the ability to influence conditions and respond effectively to changing threats and situations\nwith appropriate, flexible, and timely actions. Leaders develop their skill sets over time and learn what to\napply in given situations. This demonstrates versatility. Versatility is having the ability to succeed across a\nspectrum of demanding, tough situations. Versatility increases the likelihood of effective adaptability by\nbeing trained and ready with multiple capabilities. The leader must be willing to deviate from usual, ingrained\napproaches. Together, adaptability and versatility improve a leader\u2019s ability to anticipate and react\nappropriately to change.\n8-2 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Leadership in Practice\nADAPTABILITY\n8-8. Adaptable leaders are comfortable with ambiguity. They are flexible and innovative\u2014ready to face\nthe challenges with available resources Adaptability has two key components:\n\uf06c Ability to identify essential elements critical for performance in each new situation.\n\uf06c Ability to change practices or the unit to meet the requirement for change.\n8-9. Experienced leaders recognize when conditions change. As conditions change, leaders apply their\nexperiences to determine a way forward. Leaders exhibit this quality through critical thinking, creative\nthinking, willingness to accept risk, displaying comfort with ambiguity, and the ability to adjust rapidly while\ncontinuously assessing the situation.\n8-10. Highly adaptable leaders have the proper frame of mind for operating under mission orders. Adaptable\nleaders can quickly assess the situation and determine skills needed to address it. If skills learned in the past\nare not sufficient for success under new conditions, adaptable leaders seek to apply new or modified skills.\n8-11. Adaptive leadership includes being an agent of change. This means encouraging others to recognize\nconditions are changing and build consensus as change occurs. As consensus builds, adaptive leaders\ninfluence the course of the organization. Depending on the immediacy of the problem, adaptive leaders may\nuse several different methods for influencing their organization.\n8-12. Adaptability takes effort to develop. To become adaptable, leaders must challenge their previously\nheld ideas and assumptions by seeking out novel and unfamiliar situations. Leaders who remain safely inside\ntheir comfort zone (current level of education, training, and experience) are less likely to recognize change\nor understand inevitable changes in conditions. Mindsets affect adaptability. Developing a few systematic\nways of thinking encourages adaptability. These include open-mindedness, ability to consider multiple\nperspectives, not jumping to conclusions about what a situation is or means, willingness to take risks, and\nbeing able to overcome setbacks. To become more adaptable, leaders should\u2014\n\uf06c Embrace opportunities to adapt. Leaders must go beyond what they are comfortable with and\nexperience the unfamiliar through diverse and dynamic challenges. For example, the Army\u2019s best\ntraining uses thinking like an enemy (red teaming) to enable leaders to recognize and accept that\nno plan survives contact. Training to improve adaptability should include changing conditions and\nscenarios so that training does not become routine.\n\uf06c Seek challenges. Leaders must seek out and engage in assignments that involve major changes in\nthe environment. Leaders can be specialists, but their base of experience should still be broad. As\nthe breadth of experience accumulates, so does the capacity to adapt. Leaders exposed to different\ntypes of thinking, different people and cultural norms, everyday changes in execution, and new\nchallenges will learn the value of adaptation. They carry forward the skills to develop adaptable\nSoldiers, DA Civilians, units, and organizations.\nVERSATILITY\n8-13. Experiences form the basis of how people react to certain situations. A broader experience base offers\ngreater opportunity to be a versatile leader. Versatile leaders seek opportunities to expand their experiences.\nThey also understand the need to develop these same characteristics and qualities in their subordinates and\nteams. To promote a climate that promotes versatility, leaders maintain standards and accept constructive\nfeedback without threat of repercussion or blame. Instead, they challenge subordinates to think in new ways\nand build a broader set of trained and practiced responses.\n8-14. Leaders lacking adaptability and versatility enter every situation in the same manner and often expect\ntheir experience in one position to carry them to the next. Consequently, they may use ill-fitting or outdated\napproaches that may result in poor performance in new conditions or outright failure. Determining when and\nhow to adapt is important. Adaptability and versatility do not produce certainty that change will improve\nresults. Sometimes, persistence on a given course of action may have merit over change.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 8-3",
            "Chapter 8\nCHALLENGES OF AN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT\n8-15. Each situation a leader faces is unique and brings new challenges. Some challenges are predictable\nbased on experiences; some are unpredictable, surfacing because of a situation or place in time. Leaders must\nbe prepared to face the effects of stress, changing technology, fear in combat, geopolitical climate, and\nexternal influences from the media.\n8-16. Future leaders must be adept at operating in ambiguity and chaos while possessing technical and\nprofessional expertise that enables cognitive overmatch of the enemy. Awareness, proper training, and open,\nfrank discussion mitigate some of these factors. Army leaders must consider these external influences and\nplan accordingly. An effective leader recognizes the need to adapt in changing situations.\nEVOLVING THREATS\n8-17. Agility and adaptability at all levels of Army organizations are important to address unanticipated\nsituations. The Army must adapt to constantly evolving threats while taking advantage of the latest\ntechnological innovations and adjusting to societal changes. The uncertain nature of the threat will always\nhave major effects on Army leadership.\nMEDIA\n8-18. The media can be both an asset and impediment to leadership. Embedded media can tell the story from\nthe Soldier\u2019s perspective to an anxious nation at home. The media can provide real-time information,\nsometimes unfiltered and raw, which the enemy could exploit as a means to change the international political\nclimate. Leaders must understand the speed and scrutiny of continuous news coverage and that the enemy\ndoes not bear the same responsibility for telling the truth. Leaders must be wary of propaganda and critically\nassess the accuracy of media reports and seek information from reliable sources.\n8-19. The media not only report the situation, but also affect the situation. Leaders must train subordinate\nleaders and Soldiers to work with the media, understand the effects of pervasive media, and understand the\nlong-term effects of stories and images. Commanders synchronize actions and messages to inform domestic\naudiences and influence selected foreign audiences (see FM 3-13).\nJOINT AND MULTINATIONAL CONDITIONS\n8-20. Soldiers often find themselves serving with members of other Services, allies, and partner nation\nforces. Understanding the unique cultures and subcultures of these various groups can be essential to success\nin a volatile and changing world.\n8-21. Leaders should recognize the existence of subcultures such as law enforcement, special operations\nforces, and medical and branch-specific communities. Consequently, leaders involved in conducting\noperations need to understand how members of these specialized units train and work. Often, specialized\nunits approach missions from a different perspective and sometimes use unconventional methods to\naccomplish them. These functional subcultures can be useful as a means to exchange knowledge and provide\nsolutions when the Army needs answers from subject matter experts.\nGEOPOLITICAL SITUATION\n8-22. Though technology and economic ties interconnect the world, the world remains diverse in terms of\nreligions, cultures, living conditions, education, and health. Within the political sphere, maintaining presence\nin foreign countries through a careful mix of diplomatic and military arrangements remains an important\nchallenge. Leaders must be aware that the balance between diplomacy and military power is fragile. Army\nleaders must consistently consider the effect on local civilians, as well as on cultural and religious treasures,\nbefore committing forces.\n8-23. Leaders can expect to operate under many different conditions worldwide. While most Soldiers speak\nEnglish as their first language, continued deployments and global interaction require an understanding of\nother languages and cultures. Leaders will need to become multilingual and study the cultures and histories\nof other regions of interest. Technology provides a vehicle for gaining geopolitical knowledge.\n8-4 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Leadership in Practice\nTECHNOLOGY\n8-24. While the stresses of combat have been constant for centuries, another aspect of the human dimension\nhas assumed increasing importance\u2014the effect of rapid technological advances on organizations and people.\nTechnological changes and the speed at which they occur force the Army and its leaders to adapt and respond.\n8-25. Army leaders must stay abreast of technological advances and their applications, advantages, and\nrequirements. Together with technical specialists, leaders can make technology work for the Soldier. Properly\nintegrated technology can increase operational effectiveness, survivability, and lethality.\n8-26. Technological challenges facing Army leaders include\u2014\n\uf06c Learning the strengths and vulnerabilities of different technologies that support the organization\nand its mission.\n\uf06c Considering the ethical implications of advanced technologies.\n\uf06c Thinking through how the organization will operate with other less or more technologically\ncomplex organizations, such as operating with unified action partners.\n\uf06c Considering technological effect on the time available to analyze problems, decide, and act. Events\nhappen faster today and the stress encountered as an Army leader is correspondingly greater.\n\uf06c Using technology to influence dispersed teams given the increasing availability and necessity to\nuse reachback and split-based operations.\n8-27. Technology can lead to operational issues. A growing reliance on 'Global Positioning System (GPS)\nnavigation technology since the Desert Storm era decreased emphasis on manual land navigation skills in\ntraining, rendering forces vulnerable if the technology fails. Leaders determined how to exploit GPS\ntechnology while guarding against its weaknesses through improved training. This included reintroducing\nessential land navigation training and detailed instructions on the maintenance and operation of GPS\nequipment.\n8-28. Technology changes leadership conditions in many aspects, especially with how much information is\navailable for decision makers. Although advances allow the modern leader to handle large amounts of\ninformation more effectively than before, enhanced technology can still cause information overload. Leaders\nmust be able to sift through provided information then analyze, synthesize, and forward only important data\nup the chain of command. Senior leaders rely on subordinates to process information, isolating critical\ninformation to expedite decisions. Leaders owe their subordinates information gathering and reporting\nprocedures that streamline work for already stretched staffs and units.\n8-29. Army leaders and staffs have always needed to determine mission-critical information, prioritize\nincoming reports, and process them quickly. The volume of information provided by current technology\nmakes this ability critical. The answer lies in the agile, adaptable human mind. Sometimes a nontechnological\napproach can divert the flood of information into channels the leader and staff can manage. For example,\nunderstanding the commander\u2019s intent and commander\u2019s critical information requirements can free leaders\nfrom nonessential information overload. The Army concept of command and control is critical in conditions\nof information overload. Mission command delegates most decisions to lower echelons to free higher\nechelons for critical decisions only they can make. Army leaders should continue to resist the lure of\ncentralized decision making although they have more information available to them.\nSYSTEMS\n8-30. Army leaders require increased technical and tactical knowledge and understanding of systems.\nLeaders must understand the fine line between a healthy questioning of new systems\u2019 capabilities and an\nunreasonable hostility that rejects the advantages technology offers. The adaptable leader remains aware of\nthe capabilities and shortcomings of advanced technology and ensures subordinates do as well.\n8-31. Leaders must consider systems within their organizations\u2014how they work together, how using one\naffects others, and how to get the best performance from the whole. They must think beyond their own\norganization and consider how the actions of their organization influence other organizations as a whole.\n8-32. Technology changes battlefield dispersal and the speed of operations. Instant global communications\nare accelerating the pace of military actions. GPS and night vision capabilities mean the Army can fight at\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 8-5",
            "Chapter 8\nnight and during periods of limited visibility\u2014conditions that halted or slowed the pace of operations in the\npast. Additionally, nonlinear and noncontiguous operations create more difficulty for commanders to\ndetermine critical points on the battlefield.\n8-33. Modern technology has increased the complexity of skills the Army requires. Leaders must carefully\nmanage low-density occupational specialties and fill critical positions with properly trained people who\nmaintain proficiency in these perishable high-tech skills. Army leaders must balance leadership, personnel\nmanagement, and training management to ensure their organizations have people with the appropriate\nspecialty training and that the entire organization stays continuously trained, certified, and ready.\nHEALTH OF THE COMMAND\n8-34. The health threat faced by deployed forces is a combination of ongoing or potential enemy threats;\nadverse environmental, occupational, and geographic and meteorological conditions; endemic diseases; and\nemployment of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. To counter health threats,\ncommanders and leaders must ensure that field hygiene and sanitation, preventive medicine measures,\ninspection of potable water and field feeding facilities, sleep discipline (including work and rest schedules),\nand personal protective measures are instituted and receive command emphasis. Leaders must ensure Soldiers\npractice these activities continuously during force projection and post-deployment processes.\n8-35. Additionally, concussive injuries are associated with explosions, blasts, and blows to the head during\ncombat operations, training activities or contact sports. Leaders and Soldiers at all echelons must be aware\nof this invisible injury and receive education and training to decrease stigma associated with seeking medical\nassistance. Leaders have a responsibility to ensure their Soldiers receive a medical evaluation following a\nconcussive event, no matter how mild. Prompt medical attention maximizes recovery, decreases risk of a\nsubsequent concussion while the brain heals, and ultimately preserves combat power. For additional\ninformation on concussive injuries and leader protocols, refer to ATP 6-22.5.\nSTRESS OF CHANGE\n8-36. To succeed in conditions of continuous change, leaders emphasize the constants of the Army Values,\nteamwork, and discipline while helping subordinates anticipate change, adapt, and seek new ways to improve.\nCompetent leadership implies managing change, adapting, and making change work for the team. Leaders\ndetermine what requires explicit actions to respond to change. Often, building on what already exists limits\nstress.\n8-37. Stress is a major part of leadership conditions. Major sources of stress include an ever-changing\ngeopolitical situation, operational stress and related fears, the rapid pace of change, and the increasing\ncomplexity of technology. A leader\u2019s character and professional competence are important factors in\nmitigating stress for the organization and achieving mission accomplishment, despite environmental\npressures and changes. When dealing with these factors, adaptability is essential to success.\nOPERATIONAL STRESS\n8-38. Stress in response to threatening or uncertain situations occurs across the range of military operations\nas well as at home, in garrison, and during training exercises. Military experiences expose Soldiers to various\noperational stresses throughout their careers. Operational stress control does not minimize the experiences\nfaced while engaged in such operations, but provides mechanisms to mitigate reactions to those experiences\nso Soldiers remain combat effective and maintain the quality of life to which they are entitled (see\nATP 6-22.5).\n8-39. Leaders must understand stress and anticipate Soldiers\u2019 reactions. Overcoming obstacles, such as\nSoldiers becoming wounded or dying, or the enemy attacking unexpectedly, takes mental discipline and\nresilience. Off-site leaders cannot discount the fear Soldiers may experience. A leader who does not share\nthe same risks could easily fall into the trap of making a decision that could prove unworkable given the\nSoldiers\u2019 psychological state. Army leaders with responsibility over a distributed team should ask for detailed\ninput from the Soldiers or subordinate commanders who are closer to the action and can provide the most\naccurate information about the situation.\n8-6 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Leadership in Practice\n8-40. When preparing for sustained operations, leaders must thoroughly condition their Soldiers to address\noperational stress during all phases of force projection\u2014mobilization, deployment, employment,\nsustainment, and redeployment. Positive action to reduce operational stress empowers Army members to\ncope with typical, everyday situations and enhance adaptive stress reactions.\n8-41. When possible, Soldiers should have access to operational stress control team/behavioral health\npersonnel, medical personnel, and chaplains to continue their physical and psychological recovery to ensure\nsuccessful reintegration. Experts treating the psychologically wounded must work hand-in-hand with the unit\nchain of command to stress the importance of maintaining order and discipline. Leaders must not tolerate\naggressive or criminal behavior as compensation for negative operational experiences.\n8-42. The Army has implemented a comprehensive recovery plan for all returning Soldiers to counter\noperational stress. Sound leadership, unit cohesion, and close camaraderie are essential to assure expeditious\npsychological recovery from combat experiences.\n8-43. Leaders need to understand that danger and fear will always be a part of their duties. Fear is a natural,\nhuman reaction to danger. Courage does not mean absence of fear\u2014courage is overcoming fear to\naccomplish the mission. Battling fear means recognizing fear and effectively dealing with it. Understanding\nthe situation and acting with foresight and purpose overcomes fear. Fear of the unknown can be terrifying;\nfear can paralyze a Soldier. Soldiers who see friends killed or wounded become aware of their own mortality.\nArmy leaders must expect fear to take hold when setbacks occur, the unit fails to complete a mission, or the\nunit takes casualties.\n8-44. Preparation, planning, and rigorous training carry Soldiers through the challenges of operating under\nhazardous conditions. Leaders must add unanticipated elements to training to create demanding learning\nconditions. Realistic training developed around critical warrior tasks and battle drills is a primary source for\nthe resilience and confidence to succeed along with the ability to demonstrate grit in tough situations. Leader\ncompetence, confidence, agility, courage, and resilience enable units to persevere and find workable solutions\nto tough problems. Living the Army Values and the Army Ethic along with the Warrior Ethos and resilience\nmobilize the ability to forge success out of chaos to overcome fear, hunger, deprivation, and fatigue to\naccomplish the mission.\nCOUNTERPRODUCTIVE LEADERSHIP\n8-45. The Army expects all leaders to live the Army Values and demonstrate the positive characteristics\ndescribed by the leader attributes and core leader competencies. Effective leadership is essential for realizing\nthe full potential of an organization\u2019s combat power and can compensate for deficiencies in other warfighting\nfunctions. The opposite is also true; counterproductive leader behaviors can negate combat power advantages.\n8-46. Counterproductive leadership is the demonstration of leader behaviors that violate one or more\nof the Army's core leader competencies or Army Values, preventing a climate conducive to mission\naccomplishment. Counterproductive leadership generally leaves organizations in a worse condition than\nwhen the leader arrived and has a long-term effect on morale and readiness. The term toxic has been used\nwhen describing leaders who have engaged in what the Army now refers to as counterproductive leadership\nbehaviors. Counterproductive leadership is incompatible with Army leadership doctrine and Army Values.\nIt often violates regulations and can impede mission accomplishment.\n8-47. All leaders are susceptible to displaying counterproductive leadership behaviors in times of stress, high\noperational tempo, or other chaotic conditions to achieve short-term results. Counterproductive leadership\ndecreases followers' well-being, engagement, and undermines the organization's readiness and ability to\naccomplish the mission in the long term. It can have an adverse effect on the unit with cascading results, such\nas lowering morale, commitment, cohesion, effectiveness, readiness, and productivity. Counterproductive\nleadership behaviors prevent establishing a positive organizational climate and interfere with mission\naccomplishment, especially in highly complex operational settings. Prolonged use of counterproductive\nleadership destroys unit morale, trust, and undermines the followers' commitment to the mission.\nCounterproductive leadership can also decrease task performance, physical and psychological well-being,\nand increase negative outcomes such as depression or burnout.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 8-7",
            "Chapter 8\n8-48. Army leaders can and will make mistakes, so distinguishing between occasional errors of judgment\nand counterproductive behavior is important. Counterproductive leadership can include recurrent negative\nleader behaviors and more serious one-time behaviors that have a damaging effect on the organization's\nperformance and subordinate welfare. Infrequent or one-time negative behaviors do not define\ncounterproductive leadership. Often, counterproductive leadership behaviors have harmful effects on\nindividuals or a unit when several instances occur together or take place frequently.\n8-49. Counterproductive leadership spans a range of leader conduct that can be organized into several broad\ncategories that are useful to inform strategies for identifying and addressing such behaviors.\nCounterproductive leadership is not limited to these behaviors listed below. Leaders can demonstrate more\nthan one of the behaviors and their conduct can span multiple categories:\n\uf06c Abusive behaviors\u2014includes behaviors that involve a leader exceeding the boundaries of their\nauthority by being abusive, cruel, or degrading others. These behaviors are contrary to what is\nrequired for the moral, ethical, and legal discharge of their duty. Specific examples include, but\nare not limited to, bullying, berating others for mistakes, creating conflict, ridiculing others\nbecause of the authority held, domineering, showing little or no respect to others, insulting or\nbelittling individuals, condescending or talking down to others, or retaliating for perceived slights\nor disagreements.\n\uf06c Self-serving behaviors\u2014includes behaviors that result from self-centered motivations on the part\nof the leader, where they act in ways that seek primarily to accomplish their own goals and needs\nbefore those of others. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, displaying arrogance,\nlacking concern or empathy for others, taking credit for others' work, insisting on having their\nway, distorting information to favor own ideas, exaggerating accomplishments or abilities, putting\nown work and accomplishments ahead of others' and the mission, displaying narcissistic\ntendencies, or exhibiting a sense of entitlement.\n\uf06c Erratic behaviors\u2014includes behaviors related to poor self-control or volatility that drive the leader\nto act erratically or unpredictably. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, blaming\nothers, deflecting responsibility, losing temper at the slightest provocation, behaving\ninconsistently in words and actions, insecurity, or being unapproachable.\n\uf06c Leadership incompetence\u2014includes ineffective leadership behaviors that result from a lack of\nexperience or willful neglect. Incompetence can include failure to act or acting poorly. While\nincompetent leadership can arise from reasons unrelated to counterproductive leadership, it is\nincluded as a category often associated with arrogant or abusive leaders who are not aware of their\nshortcomings and do not seek to correct their shortcomings. Conversely, some leaders lacking\ncompetence are aware of their shortcomings, which lead them to behave in counterproductive or\nnegative ways to cover up their shortcomings or mistakes. Specific examples include, but are not\nlimited to, unengaged leadership, being passive or reactionary, neglecting leadership\nresponsibilities, displaying poor judgment, poorly motivating others, withholding encouragement,\nfailing to clearly communicate expectations, or refusing to listen to subordinates.\n\uf06c Corrupt behaviors\u2014includes behaviors that violate explicit Army standards, regulations, or\npolicies. Violations may range from behaviors subject to administrative discipline to criminal\nactions subject to discharge or incarceration. Specific examples include, but are not limited to,\ndishonesty, misusing government resources or time, creating a hostile work environment,\nEEO/SHARP violations, or violating Section 3583 (Requirement of Exemplary Conduct), Title\n10, United States Code, AR 600-100, or the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n8-50. As the Army moves into increasingly more complex operational environments, it is critical that leaders\nrely on positive behaviors to influence others and achieve results. The Army is committed to stopping these\nnegative behaviors and promoting positive work environments. All leaders are susceptible to\ncounterproductive behaviors, so they must monitor their personal behavior. Commanders and leaders have a\nresponsibility to monitor and take action to eliminate counterproductive leadership. All Army members who\nwitness these behaviors have a responsibility to prevent, intervene, counter, or mitigate them. Soldiers and\nDA Civilians must be willing to confront and address these behaviors in their units and should leverage their\nchains of command to assist and involve relevant installation resources where and when necessary.\n8-8 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "PART THREE\nLeading at Organizational and Strategic Levels\nPart Three addresses organizational and strategic leaders in additional detail. Both\norganizationaand strategic leaders are still direct leaders. This part describes what\nmakes organizational and strategic leaders unique from direct leaders.\nChapter 9\nOrganizational Leadership\nYou have to lead men in war by requiring more from the individual than he thinks he can\ndo. You have to lead men in war by bringing them along to endure and to display qualities\nof fortitude that are beyond the average man\u2019s thought of what he should be expected to\ndo. You have to inspire them when they are hungry and exhausted and desperately\nuncomfortable and in great danger; and only a man of positive characteristics of\nleadership, with the physical stamina that goes with it, can function under those conditions.\nGeneral of the Army George C. Marshall\nTestimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Military Affairs (1940)\nLEADING\n9-1. Whether they fight for key terrain or work to achieve training readiness, organizational leaders must\nbe able to translate complex concepts into understandable plans their subordinates can execute.\nOrganizational leaders develop the plans and synchronize the systems that allow subordinates to turn ideas\ninto action.\n9-2. Organizational leaders build teams of teams with discipline, cohesion, trust, and proficiency through\npersonal example, using a wide range of knowledge and applying leader competencies. They focus their\norganizations down to the lowest level on the mission by disseminating a clear intent, sound concepts, and a\nsystematic approach to execution.\n9-3. Organizational leaders build on direct leader experiences, reflect the Army Values, and instill pride\nwithin organizations. Since they lead complex organizations throughout the Army\u2019s generating forces and\noperating forces, organizational leaders often apply elements of direct and organizational leadership\nsimultaneously.\nLEADS OTHERS\n9-4. Organizational leaders have developed a strong background in fundamentals as well as an appreciation\nfor the geopolitical implications of their situation. From their experiences, they have developed the instincts,\nintuition, and knowledge that form their understanding of the interrelation of the levels of leadership. Their\nrefined skills allow them to understand, integrate, and synchronize the activities of multiple systems and\nemploy resources and systems across a range of challenges.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 9-1",
            "Chapter 9\n9-5. Given the increased size of their organizations, organizational leaders influence indirectly more often\nthan directly. Soldiers and subordinate leaders look to their organizational leaders to set achievable standards,\nto provide clear intent, and to provide the necessary resources. Decisions and actions by organizational\nleaders have greater consequences for more people over a longer time than those of direct leaders. Since the\nconnections between action and effect are sometimes more remote and difficult to see, organizational leaders\nspend more time than direct leaders coordinating, thinking, and reflecting about what they are doing and how\nthey are doing it. Organizational leaders develop clear concepts for operations as well as policies and\nprocedures to control and monitor execution.\nEXTENDS INFLUENCE BEYOND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND\n9-6. While organizational leaders primarily exert direct influence through their chain of command and staff,\nthey extend influence beyond their chain of command and organization by other means. These other means\ninclude persuasion, empowerment, motivation, negotiation, conflict resolution, bargaining, advocacy, and\ndiplomacy. They often apply such skills when serving as military negotiators, consensus builders, and a direct\ninterface to local populace.\n9-7. Today\u2019s operations present Army leaders, particularly organizational leaders, with nonlinear, dynamic,\nand ambiguous conditions. These varied, information-intense conditions challenge leaders to synchronize\nefforts beyond the traditional military chain of command. Likely mission complexities demand the full\nintegration and cooperation of unified action partners to accomplish missions.\n9-8. Establishing effective relationships with unified action partners is an important step. Organizational\nleaders and their staffs must understand joint doctrine as well as Army fundamentals and procedures.\nAdditionally, corps or divisions may have control over forces from other nations. They may work with liaison\nofficers from other nations. In some cases, U.S. Army or U.S. joint force staffs may have members of other\nnations permanently assigned. Echelons of command often have interagency representation embedded in\ntheir staffs or operating in their areas. Leaders therefore impart influence through their conduct\u2014striving to\nset a positive impression of themselves, the Army, and the Nation they serve.\nLEADS BY EXAMPLE\n9-9. The Army\u2019s organizational leaders play a critical part in maintaining focus on fighting the enemy and\nnot the plan. They are at the forefront of adapting to operational environment changes and exploiting\nemerging opportunities by applying a combination of intuition, analytical problem solving, systems\nintegration, and leadership by example\u2014as close to the action as feasible.\n9-10. Organizational leaders position themselves with the necessary means to maintain contact with critical\nelements and headquarters. Proximity to operations provides organizational commanders with the required\nawareness to apply quick creative thinking in collaboration with subordinate leaders. Proximity facilitates\nadjustments for deficiencies in planning and shortens reaction time when applying sound tactical and\noperational solutions to changing realities. Operations require leaders who understand the context of factors\naffecting the situation, act within that understanding, continually assess and adapt those actions based on the\ninteractions and circumstances of the enemy and conditions, consolidate tactical and operational\nopportunities into strategic aims, and are able to effectively transition operations.\n9-11. .Organizational leaders prioritize what changes their organization will pursue and guide their\norganizations through several steps to ensure their initiatives for change last. The steps of the leading change\nprocess are\u2014\n\uf06c Assess the need for change (anticipate problems or identify opportunities).\n\uf06c Build a guiding coalition.\n\uf06c Create and communicate a compelling vision.\n\uf06c Determine how to implement vision (design plan, gather resources).\n\uf06c Empower others to act.\n\uf06c Facilitate learning (promote new skill development).\n\uf06c Goal reinforcement (identify and reinforce evidence of progress).\n\uf06c Hone the change process through monitoring and reinvesting.\n9-2 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Organizational Leadership\n\uf06c Institutionalize change (modify policies or procedures).\nCOMMUNICATES\n9-12. Leaders are responsible for ensuring shared understanding. They should share information as much as\npossible with their organization and subordinates. An open, two-way exchange of information reinforces\nsharing team values and encourages constructive input.\n9-13. Communicating openly and clearly with superiors is important for organizational leaders.\nUnderstanding the intent, priorities, and thought processes makes anticipating future planning and resourcing\npriorities easier. Understanding the direction of the higher headquarters reduces course corrections at lower\nlevels, thus minimizing friction and maintaining a stable organizational tempo and climate.\nUsing the Staff as a Communications Tool\n9-14. Organizational leaders need to understand what is happening within their organization, developing\nlaterally, and unfolding within the next two higher echelons. Networking between staffs gives organizational\nleaders a broader picture of the overall operational environment. Coordination allows leaders to constantly\ninteract and share thoughts, ideas, and priorities through multiple channels, creating a more complete picture.\nWith reliable information, staffs can productively turn policies, concepts, plans, and programs into achievable\nresults and quality products.\n9-15. By interacting with the next-higher staff, organizational leaders understand the superior\u2019s priorities\nand impending shifts in focus or guidance. This helps inform their own organizational requirements and\nchanges. Constantly sensing, observing, questioning, and actively listening enables organizational leaders to\nidentify and solve potential problems or to avoid them. Communication allows them to anticipate decisions\nand put their organization in the best possible position in time and space to appropriately respond and execute.\nUsing Persuasion to Build Teams and Consensus\n9-16. Persuasion is an important communication method for organizational leaders. Well-developed skills\nof persuasion and openness to working through controversy help organizational leaders overcome resistance\nand build support in a positive manner. By reducing grounds for misunderstanding, persuasion reduces time\nwasted overcoming unimportant issues. Persuasion is an important method of extending influence. Working\nthrough controversy in a positive, open way overcomes resistance to an idea or plan and builds support. By\ndemonstrating these traits, organizational leaders provide an example that subordinates can use in self-\ndevelopment. In some circumstances, persuasion may be inappropriate. During operations, leaders must often\nmake decisions quickly, requiring a more direct style when leading and deciding on courses of action.\nDEVELOPING\n9-17. Comparatively, organizational leaders take a long-term approach to developing the entire organization.\nThey prepare their organizations for the next quarter, next year, or five years from now. The responsibility\nto determine how the Army fights the next war lies with today\u2019s Army leaders, especially those at the\norganizational and strategic levels. Leaders at the organizational level rely more on indirect leadership\nmethods, which can make leading, developing, and achieving more difficult.\nCREATES A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n9-18. An organization\u2019s climate springs from its leader\u2019s attitudes, actions, and priorities communicated\nthrough choices, policies, and programs. Leaders in organizational leadership positions determine the\norganizational climate by assessing the organization from the bottom up. An organizational leader can initiate\ncommand climate surveys to collect climate input while protecting individual anonymity. Organizational-\nlevel leaders ensure company commanders meet requirements for initial and annual climate surveys (see\nAR 600-20). These leaders should assess subordinate command climate results and supplemental indicators\nsuch as instances of misconduct. With a completed assessment, the leader can provide clear guidance and\nfocus (purpose, direction, and motivation) to move the organization toward the desired end state.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 9-3",
            "Chapter 9\n9-19. Characteristics of successful organizational climates include a clear, widely known purpose; well\ntrained, confident Soldiers and DA Civilians; disciplined, cohesive teams; and trusted, competent leaders. It\nis a climate that adheres to and promotes the Army Values and fosters the Warrior Ethos, encourages learning,\npromotes creativity and performance, and establishes cohesion. To create such a climate, organizational\nleaders recognize mistakes as opportunities to learn, create cohesive teams, and reward leaders of character\nand competence with increasing responsibilities. Organizational leaders value honest feedback and constantly\nuse available means to maintain a feel for the organization. Special staff members including equal opportunity\nadvisors, chaplains, medical officers, and legal advisors assist the organizational leader with maintaining a\npositive environment.\nPREPARES SELF\n9-20. The demands on leaders vary at different levels. While leader competencies stay the same across levels,\nmoving from direct to the organizational level requires a shift in approach. What may occupy a great deal of\na leader\u2019s time at a lower level (for example, face-to-face supervision of Soldiers) involves less time at higher\nlevels. Certain technical skills vital to a direct leader will be of less importance to an organizational leader\nwho must spend time on system-wide issues. Leaders need to accustom themselves to rely on less direct\nmeans of direction, control, and monitoring to aid their transition in the scope and breadth of responsibilities.\n9-21. Organizational leaders keep a focus on where the organization needs to go and what leaders must be\ncapable of accomplishing. As role models, they develop themselves and actively counsel their subordinate\nleaders about their professional growth. Organizational leaders continue to seek broadening experiences to\nexpand their knowledge, skills, and capabilities. At the organizational level, leaders ensure that systems and\nconditions are in place for objective feedback, counseling, and mentoring for all organization members,\nincluding themselves.\n9-22. Self-aware organizational leaders who know their organizations generally achieve high quality results\nand do not shy away from asking close subordinates to give informal feedback as part of an open, transparent\nassessment and feedback effort. When they are part of official AARs, organizational leaders should invite\nsubordinates to comment on how the leaders could have made things better. Subordinates easily spot errors\nby organizational leaders since these errors often affect those lead. Consequently, admitting, analyzing, and\nlearning from these errors add value to the training. For the Army\u2019s organizational leaders\u2014just as leaders\nat other levels\u2014reflecting, learning, and applying corrective actions in operations is critical for effectiveness.\nDEVELOPS OTHERS\n9-23. Organizational-level leaders are stewards of the Army profession. They fulfill this function by placing\na high priority upon investment in future leaders at all levels. Leader development is an investment required\nto maintain the Army as a profession and is a key source of combat power. Organizational leaders set\nconditions for a robust leader development system and create conditions that enable organization members\nto learn from their experiences and those of others. They rely on conditions that use learning as well as self-\ndevelopment through various procedures such as 360 assessments. To strengthen learning, organizational\nleaders can make numerous avenues available for lifelong learning: assignment-oriented training,\nsimulations, learning centers, and virtual training.\n9-24. Organizational leaders determine the potential of others. This takes awareness of others and flexibility\nto build on strengths and address weaknesses. Developing others at this level is challenging; the\norganizational leader has to balance the criticality of the task and the developmental needs of all subordinates.\nAnother consideration for organizational leaders is how and what individuals need to learn. Learning in\nchallenging situations may be a good way for leaders to learn from failure, but others need to experience\nmore successes than failures to develop self-confidence and initiative. Organizational leaders lead, coach,\nand mentor subordinate leaders.\nBuilding Team Skills and Processes\n9-25. Organizational leaders recognize that the Army is a team of teams, composed of numerous functional\norganizations. These organizations perform necessary tasks and missions that coordinate the effort of all\n9-4 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Organizational Leadership\nArmy components. Strategic leaders influence organizational leaders. Organizational leaders, in turn,\ninfluence subordinate leaders to achieve organizational goals.\n9-26. Generally, organizational leaders rely on others to follow and execute their intent and guidance as well\nas to communicate effectively that intent and guidance to subordinates. Turning a battlefield vision or training\ngoal into reality takes the combined efforts of many teams inside and outside of the organization.\nOrganizational leaders build solid, effective teams by developing and training them.\n9-27. By circulating among subordinate units, organizational leaders can assess subordinates\u2019 understanding\nof intent, preparation, execution, and assure successful command and control. Organizational leaders learn\nabout units in the task organization and personally motivate Soldiers by their presence. Organizational leaders\nwork with subordinate units to create shared understanding. Together they identify options of greatest value\nand manage high-risk actions. Organizational leaders act with other leaders across the chain of command to\ncreate context for fostering organizational and team capabilities.\n9-28. Well-trained subordinates who work hard and fight tenaciously sense they are part of a first-rate team.\nCollective confidence comes from succeeding under challenging, stressful conditions. Sense of belonging\nderives from experiencing technical and tactical proficiency\u2014first as individuals and later collectively. That\nproficiency expresses itself in the confidence team members have in their peers and leaders and trust shared\nwith each other. Ultimately, cohesive teams combine into a network\u2014a team of teams. Cohesive\norganizations work in synchronized fashion to complete tasks and missions.\nEncouraging Initiative and Acceptance of Responsibility\n9-29. Since missions for larger organizations are more complex and involve concurrent efforts, leaders at\nhigher levels must encourage subordinate initiative. Effective organizational leaders must delegate authority,\nsupport their subordinates\u2019 decisions, and hold them accountable for their actions.\n9-30. Successful delegation of authority involves convincing subordinates that they are empowered and have\nthe freedom to act independently. Empowered subordinates understand that they bear more than the\nresponsibility to accomplish tasks. They have the authority to operate as they see fit, within the limits of the\ncommander\u2019s intent and available resources. This helps them lead their people with determination.\n9-31. Since delegation is a critical factor for success in organizations, leaders must know the talents of their\nsubordinates and prepare them to assume critical roles when necessary. To empower the diverse elements\nwithin a larger organization, organizational leaders must exploit the value of a creative staff composed of\ncompetent and trustworthy subordinates. Organizational leaders develop the competence and judgment of\ntheir staffs to handle greater responsibility.\nChoosing Talented Staff Leaders\n9-32. Building a high-performing staff begins with putting the right people in the right positions.\nOrganizational leaders make time to evaluate the staff and develop them to full capability. They avoid\nmicromanaging the staff while trusting and empowering them to think creatively and provide truthful answers\nand feasible options. For example, an important decision is getting the right chief of staff or deputy. The chief\nof staff or deputy is the principal assistant for directing, coordinating, supervising, and training the staff. This\nleader earns the respect of the staff, focuses them, inspires them, and moves them to achieve results. Although\nstaff sections work as equals, they require good leadership from their chief of staff to make them function as\na cohesive team.\n9-33. Inquisitive leaders who conduct regular assessments of themselves and their organizations hold their\norganizations to the highest standards. Open-minded reflection and corrective action in training is critical for\neffective performance in crisis. This continuous assessment process enables organizational leaders to\ntranslate lessons learned into usable knowledge.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 9-5",
            "Chapter 9\nACHIEVING\n9-34. For consistent results, organizational leaders have to be competent in planning, preparing, executing,\nand assessing. They must provide clear focus with their intent so subordinates accomplish the mission,\nregardless of the original plan.\nPROVIDING DIRECTION, GUIDANCE, AND CLEAR PRIORITIES\n9-35. Organizational leaders are more likely than direct leaders to provide guidance and make decisions with\nincomplete information. Part of the organizational leaders\u2019 analysis must determine which decisions to make\nthemselves or push to lower levels. While determining the right course of action, they consider possible\nsecond- and third-order effects and project into the future\u2014months or years. Organizational leaders must\nconsider the timing of their decisions. In many cases, organizational leaders must exercise patience and not\nmake decisions before allowing subordinates time to overcome the frictions inherent to military operations.\nMASTERING RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS\n9-36. During operations, organizational leaders integrate and synchronize available resources. They assign\nmissions and empower their subordinates to execute within the given intent. Effective organizational leaders\nmust be resourcing experts, which requires significant education and self-study. Achieving organizational\ngoals requires resources\u2014including time, equipment, facilities, budgets, and people. Organizational leaders\naggressively manage and prioritize the resources at their disposal to ensure optimal readiness of the\norganization. A leader\u2019s situation is more difficult when unanticipated events shift priorities.\n9-37. Organizational leaders are stewards of their people\u2019s time and energy, as well as their own. They do\nnot waste resources but skillfully evaluate objectives, anticipate resource requirements, and efficiently\nallocate what is available. They balance available resources with organizational requirements and distribute\nthem in a way that best achieves organizational goals. Because of the more indirect nature of their influence,\norganizational leaders continuously assess interrelated systems and design longer-term plans to accomplish\nmissions.\n9-38. Leaders who reach the organizational level should have a comprehensive systems perspective, clearly\nunderstanding how all the elements of combat power work together. These systems provide the framework\nfor influencing people and organizations at all levels. They are the foundation for conducting a wide variety\nof operations and continually improving the organization and the force.\n9-39. Organizational leaders process tremendous amounts of information. Analysis and synthesis are\nessential to effective decision making and program development. Analysis breaks a problem into its\ncomponent parts. Synthesis assembles complex and disorganized data into solutions. Good information\nmanagement filters relevant information to enable organizational leaders and staffs to exercise effective\ncommand and control. Information management uses procedures and information systems to collect, process,\nstore, display, and disseminate information.\n9-40. While a single leader in isolation can make good decisions, the organizational leader needs a creative\nstaff to make quality decisions during continuous operations of long duration. In the complex operational\nenvironments faced today, organizational leaders must be able to rely on an experienced and trustworthy staff\nand other experts to acquire and filter huge amounts of information, monitor vital resources, synchronize\nsystems, and assess operational progress and success.\nUNDERSTANDING AND SYNCHRONIZING SYSTEMS FOR COMBAT POWER\n9-41. Leaders apply a systems perspective to develop and employ their organizations. The ability to\nunderstand and effectively employ systems is critical to achieving organizational goals, objectives, and tasks.\nOrganizational leadership, combined with effective information and integration of the warfighting functions,\ngenerates combat power.\n9-42. Effective organizational leaders excel at tactical and operational synchronization. They must arrange\nactivities in time, space, and purpose to mass maximum relative combat power or organizational effort at a\ndecisive point. Organizational leaders further synchronize by applying the complementary and reinforcing\n9-6 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Organizational Leadership\neffects of joint military and nonmilitary assets to overwhelm opponents. Effective synchronization and\nintegration requires leaders to pull together technical, interpersonal, and conceptual abilities and apply them\nto warfighting goals, objectives, and tasks.\nASSESSING TO ENSURE MISSION SUCCESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVEMENT\n9-43. Assessing situations\u2014looking at the state of the organization and its component elements\u2014is critical\nfor organizational leaders to achieve consistent results and mission success. Accurate assessment requires\ntheir instincts and intuitions based on the reliability of information and their sources. Quality organizational\nassessment can determine weaknesses and force focused improvements.\n9-44. Besides designing effective assessment systems, organizational leaders set achievable, measurable\nassessment standards. Organizational leaders ask\u2014\n\uf06c What is the standard?\n\uf06c Does the standard make sense to all concerned?\n\uf06c Did we meet the standard?\n\uf06c What system measures the standard?\n\uf06c Who is responsible for the system?\n\uf06c How do we reinforce or correct our findings?\n9-45. Because their decisions can have wide-ranging effects, leaders must be sensitive to how their actions\naffect the organization\u2019s climate. The ability to discern and predict second- and third-order effects benefits\norganizational leaders in assessing the health of the organizational climate and providing constructive\nfeedback to subordinates.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 9-7",

Strategic leaders represent a finely balanced combination of high-level thinkers, accomplished\nSoldiers, and military experts. Strategic leaders simultaneously sustain what is necessary within current\nconditions, envision the future, and convey that vision to a wide audience. They often personally spearhead\nchange. Their policies guide lifecycles and talent management of all Army personnel. They guide the design\nand employment of technological advances and establish programs that care for Army families. They secure\nresources for facilities and infrastructure, weapons and equipment, supply and maintenance, and manpower\nand force structure. America\u2019s complex national security conditions require strategic leaders with an in-depth\nknowledge of the diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of national power.\n10-2. Strategic leadership involves the activities to affect the achievement of a desirable and clearly\nunderstood vision. It focuses on influencing Army culture, securing and prioritizing resources, and shaping\nand supporting organizational and direct level leaders. These goals are realized through directives, policies,\nprograms, systems, and consensus building.\n10-3. Strategic leaders serve inside or outside the Army and must thoroughly understand political-military\nrelationships. Army strategic leaders have responsibilities that extend beyond the Army to the national\ngovernment, its leaders, and ultimately, to the American people. Senior Army leaders are the strategic\nstewards of the profession. At the strategic level, senior Army leaders address ends, ways, and means to\naccomplish global missions. They maintain the trust of the American people by living and upholding the\nArmy Values in their decisions and actions taken in regard to policies, programs, systems and the care they\nprovide to Soldiers, DA Civilians, and Army Families. Those serving in strategic leadership positions may\nlead complex organizations composed of members of the U.S. Army, other U.S. armed services, and those\nof other nations, members of federal agencies, and non-governmental entities. Strategic leaders, regardless\nof position, apply professional expertise and uphold the Army Values.\n10-4. Strategic leaders have a stewardship responsibility for the relationship between the military and civilian\nleaders of the Army. Leaders take an oath of office that subordinates the military leader to the laws of the\nNation and its elected and appointed leaders, creating a distinct civil-military relationship. Army\nprofessionals understand this and appreciate the critical role this concept has played throughout America's\nhistory. Equally important, this concept requires military professionals to understand the role of civilian\nleaders and their responsibilities to the civilian leadership. A critical element of this relationship is the trust\nthat civilian leaders have in their military leaders to represent the military and provide professional military\nadvice. Military professionals have unique expertise, and their input is vital to formulating and executing\ndefense policy. Based on mutual trust, this relationship requires candor and authority to execute the decisions\nof the civilian leaders. These decisions provide the strategic direction and framework in which strategic\nmilitary leaders operate.\n10-5. To maintain focus, strategic leaders survey conditions to understand the context for their roles. Highly\ndeveloped interpersonal abilities and intergroup relations are essential to building consensus with civilian\nand military policy makers on national and international levels. Strategic leaders must think in multiple\ntimelines to anticipate change and be agile to manage change. Strategic leaders extend influence in conditions\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 10-1",

Strategic leaders are keenly aware of the complexities of national and international security conditions.\nThey operate in intricate networks of overlapping and sometimes competing constituencies. Strategic leaders\nidentify trends, opportunities, and threats that could affect the Army\u2019s future and move vigorously to address\nthem. Their actions affect acquisitions, budget constraints, Total Army issues, civilian programs, research,\ncontracting, congressional hearings, and inter-service cooperation. Strategic leaders process information\nfrom these areas while assessing alternatives. They formulate practical decisions and garner support.\n10-7. Strategic leaders operate with the same attributes and competencies as direct and organizational\nleaders. The situations and conditions create differences in how attributes and competencies apply. In general,\nstrategic leaders accommodate\u2014\n\uf06c Greater complexity under high uncertainty.\n\uf06c Broader scope with longer time spans.\n\uf06c Greater risks and stakes.\n\uf06c Greater need for indirect methods of influence.\n\uf06c National-level interests, goals, and priorities.\n10-8. Strategic leaders understand the influence of their decisions and actions and contribute their best efforts\nto accomplish the strategic mission. They set the example for the Army and inspire others to do what is\nright\u2014for its own sake\u2014and understand that violations of the Army Values can compromise the mission\nand have strategic implications contrary to national interests.\n10-9. While direct and organizational leaders have a more near- and mid-term focus, strategic leaders must\nconcentrate on the future. They spend much of their time looking toward long-term goals and positioning for\nlong-term success as they contend with mid-term and immediate issues.\n10-10. To create powerful organizations and institutions capable of adaptation, strategic leaders and their\nstaffs develop networks of knowledgeable individuals who can positively develop their own organizations.\nThrough continuous assessments, strategic leaders seek to understand the personal strengths and weaknesses\nof the main players on a particular issue. Strategic leaders adeptly read other people while disciplining their\nown actions and reactions. Strategic leaders influence external events by providing quality leadership, timely\nand relevant information, and access to the right people and agencies.\nLEADING\n10-11. When leading at the highest levels of the Army, the DOD, and the national security establishment,\nArmy strategic leaders spearhead changes and, at the same time, must balance risks. They balance current\noperational risks against future institutional or operational risks. To mitigate future institutional risks, these\nleaders are responsible for providing leadership to the men and women who serve in their organizations and\ndeveloping their successors to meet future challenges.\nLEADS OTHERS\n10-12. Strategic leaders influence both the organization and external conditions.

Envisioning is a key function of strategic leaders made possible by their insight and expertise.\nLeaders determine a vision by applying thoughtful analysis and judgment to the current or projected situation.\nStrategic leaders identify trends, opportunities, and threats that could affect the Army\u2019s future and move\nvigorously to mobilize the talent that will create strategic vision. Strategic leaders are open to ideas from\nmany sources, not just their own organizations.\n10-15. When providing vision, direction, giving guidance, and setting priorities, strategic leaders must\njudge realistically what the future may hold. Strategic leaders seek to keep their vision consistent with\nexternal conditions, alliance goals, and national strategy. They incorporate new ideas, technologies, and\ncapabilities. From a mix of ideas, facts, conjecture, and personal experience, they create an image of their\norganizations and the means to achieve desired results. A strategic leader\u2019s vision may have a time horizon\nof years or decades.\n10-16. The ability to provide clear vision is vital to the strategic leader. The strategic leader\u2019s vision\nprovides the ultimate sense of purpose, direction, and motivation. This vision is the starting point for\ndeveloping goals and plans, measuring accomplishment, and checking organizational values. For a vision to\nbe effective, the strategic leader must personally commit to it, gain commitment from the organization as a\nwhole, and persistently pursue the goals and objectives that will spread the vision throughout the\norganization.\nEXTENDS INFLUENCE\n10-17. Strategic leaders use focused messages to extend influence and to gain support. Whether by nuance\nor overt presentation, strategic leaders represent the Army and influence other organizations and agencies by\ncommunicating what the Army does. Their audience is the Army itself, the Nation, and the rest of the world.\nStrategic leaders must be proactive in creating relationships. Extending influence requires a shift from direct\ninfluence to greater reliance on indirect methods. They focus on increasing engagement with multiple parties\nor organizations and creating conditions to maximize unity of effort. Strategic leaders rely on writing and\npublic speaking to reinforce their central messages.\n10-18. Successful negotiating requires a wide range of interpersonal skills. Strategic leaders must often rely\non negotiation skills to obtain the cooperation and support necessary to accomplish a mission. To resolve\nconflicting views, strategic leaders visualize several possible end states while maintaining a clear idea of the\nbest end state from the national command\u2019s perspective. Strategic leaders must use tact to justify standing\nfirm on nonnegotiable points while still communicating respect for other participants.\n10-19. A successful negotiator must be particularly skilled in active listening. Other essential personal\ncharacteristics include logical judgment and mental agility. Successful negotiating involves communicating\na clear position on the issues while conveying a willingness to bargain on negotiable portions. Negotiators\nmust be able to diagnose unspoken agendas and detach themselves from the negotiation process. This requires\nrecognizing what is acceptable to all concerned parties and working toward a common goal.\n10-20. To reach acceptable consensus in negotiations, strategic leaders often circulate proposals early so\nthat further negotiations can focus on critical issues and solutions. Strategic leaders\u2019 commitment to selfless\nservice enables them to subordinate the need for personal recognition for ideas to finding positive solutions\nthat produce the greatest good for their organization, the Army, and the Nation.\n10-21. Outside Army boundaries, strategic leaders have roles as integrator, alliance builder, negotiator, and\narbitrator. Strategic leaders are skilled at reaching consensus and building coalitions. They may apply these\nskills to tasks\u2014such as designing combatant commands, joint task forces, and policy working-groups\u2014or\ndetermine the direction of a major command or the Army as an institution. Strategic leaders routinely bring\ndesignated people together for missions lasting from a few months to years. Using peer leadership rather than\nstrict positional authority, strategic leaders carefully monitor progress toward a visualized end state. They\nfocus on the health of the relationships necessary to achieve the end state. Interpersonal contact sets the tone\nfor professional relations: strategic leaders must be tactful.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 10-3",
            "Chapter 10\n10-22. General Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s creation of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force\nduring World War II is an inspiring example of coalition building and sustaining fragile relationships.\nGeneral Eisenhower exercised his authority through an integrated command and staff structure that respected\nthe contributions of all nations involved. To underscore the united team spirit, sections within had chiefs of\none nationality and deputies of another.\nAcross the Atlantic\nDuring World War II, General George C. Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, had to seek\nstrategic consensus with demanding peers such as Admiral Ernest J. King,\nCommander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, and Chief of Naval Operations. General Marshall\nexpended great personal energy ensuring that inter-Service feuding at the top did not\ndilute American efforts. Admiral King, a forceful leader with strong and often differing\nviews, responded in kind. Because of their ability to find consensus, President Franklin\nD. Roosevelt had few issues of major consequence to resolve once he issued a\ndecision and guidance.\nLEADS BY EXAMPLE\n10-23. Strategic leaders are the ultimate representatives of the organization, its cause, and purpose. As the\ntop leaders for the Nation\u2019s military, they also represent our country as diplomats and national\nrepresentatives. Due to their elevated level of responsibilities and visibility, the Army holds strategic leaders\nto higher expectations and increased scrutiny. They must exude positivity and confidence. Strategic leaders\nuse multiple outlets to convey strategic messages and set necessary conditions to advance national security\ninterests. Their responsibilities involve spanning the boundaries among the Army and other Services,\nmilitaries, coalitions, Congress, industry, and the media.\n10-24. Due to increased responsibilities and longer horizons of their decision making, timing, and attention\nto detail are vital. A strategic leader\u2019s decision at a critical moment can rapidly alter the course of events or\naffect the execution of budgets several years into the future. Strategic leaders have to set the example for time\nmanagement. Effective leaders at the strategic level not only make timely decisions but also sense at what\nlevel of detail to engage and what to delegate. Strategic leaders judiciously seek counsel from established\nnetworks and invest sufficient time to prepare for decisions. Likewise, poor focus and poor time management\ncan have enormous cascading effects.\n10-25. Strategic leaders best address complexity by embracing it. This means they expand their frame of\nreference to fit a situation rather than reducing a situation to fit their preconceptions. Because of their sense\nof duty, competence, intellectual capacity, and judgment, they tolerate ambiguity, as they will never have all\nthe information wanted. Instead, strategic leaders carefully analyze events and confidently decide when to\nmake a decision, realizing that they must innovate and accept some risk.\n10-26. Resilience is a means for strategic leaders to handle the stress from frequent changes, ambiguity,\nand complexity\u2014all characteristics of strategic- and enterprise-level operations. Improving self-awareness\nand self-mastery helps build and sustain resiliency. Resiliency is the product of work-life balance, effective\ntime management, family and peer support systems, along with access to executive health programs and\neducation about stressors.\nCOMMUNICATES\n10-27. Words have international consequences at the strategic level. Communication at the strategic level\nencompasses a wide array of staffs and functional and operational component teams interacting with each\nother as well as external agencies. In their interaction with others, strategic leaders need a sharp sense of\norganizational and personal dynamics. One prominent difference between strategic leaders and leaders at\nother levels is the greater emphasis on symbolic communication. Strategic leaders must carefully consider\nthe enduring nature of all their communications. Strategic leaders\u2019 words, decisions, and actions often have\nconsequences beyond their immediate intent.\n10-4 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Strategic Leadership\n10-28. Candor and integrity must always be hallmarks of a strategic leader to earn general trust. They must\ncarefully use their authority to identify messages and convey them to the right target audiences. Knowing\nwhen to speak and to whom can be just as important as what is said. To achieve desired outcomes, strategic\nleaders commit to a few powerful and consistent messages that they repeat in different settings. They devise\nand follow a communications plan outlining how to address each audience. When preparing to address an\naudience, they determine its composition and agenda beforehand so they know how best to reach its members.\nThey carefully assess the message effect in the categories of medium, frequency, vocabulary, and context.\nEnsuring the message goes to the right groups with the desired effect is essential.\n10-29. Strategic leaders use dialogue to persuade individuals or groups. Dialogue takes the forms of\nadvocacy and inquiry. Advocacy seeks to advance a position while inquiry looks to find out about another\u2019s\nposition or perspective. Dialogue that blends the two has value for leaders who must address issues more\ncomplex than personal experience. To advocate a view, leaders make reasoning explicit, invite others to\nconsider the view, encourage others to provide different views, and explore how views differ. When inquiring\ninto another\u2019s view, leaders should voice their assumptions and seek to identify what support exists for other\nviews. Open dialogue can overcome reluctance to consider different points of view.\nDEVELOPING\n10-30. Strategic leaders invest in subordinates with a long-term focus. They create the conditions for long-\nterm success by endorsing systems and processes that develop subordinates who can continue to improve the\ninstitution. Developing the institution, its organizations, and people involves an ongoing balance of operating\ntoday and building for tomorrow and, in general, being stewards of the resources the Nation entrusts to its\ncare.\nPREPARES SELF\n10-31. Strategic leaders develop throughout their career. An honest understanding of self is important to be\nable to draw on strengths and compensate for weaknesses. Neither General Marshall nor General Eisenhower\nhad led troops in combat before assuming strategic leadership positions in World War II, but both were\ninstrumental in preparing and leading the United States and its allies to victory. Eisenhower especially felt\ndisadvantaged by his lack of experience. Both future strategic leaders compensated with professional\neducation between the wars, gaining a strategic appreciation of the conditions and the future that was far\nbetter than those with extensive combat experience were.\n10-32. Strategic leaders bring forward their mastery of broad leadership and technical skills. Strategic\nleaders, more so than direct and organizational leaders, draw on their developed conceptual abilities to\ncomprehend and manage complex concerns. These challenges include national security, theater strategies,\noperating in the strategic context, and evolving vast organizations. The variety and scope of strategic leaders\u2019\nconcerns demand greater preparation.\n10-33. Self-aware Army leaders build a personal frame of reference from schooling, experience, self-study,\nand assessment while reflecting on current events, history, and geography. Strategic leaders create a\ncomprehensive frame of reference that encompasses their entire organization and places it within strategic\nconditions. Strategic leaders are unafraid to rethink experiences to learn from them. They are comfortable\nwith abstractions common to operational and strategic conditions. A well-developed frame of reference gives\nstrategic leaders a thorough knowledge of organizational subsystems. Aware of relationships among systems,\nstrategic leaders foresee the possible effects of one system upon others, which allows them to anticipate and\nprevent potential problems. Using their understanding of the systems within their own organizations, strategic\nleaders work through the complexity and uncertainty of the operational environment and translate abstract\nconcepts into concrete actions.\n10-34. Strategic leaders train staffs and organizational teams to package concise, unbiased information and\nbuild networks across organizational lines. Strategic leaders make wide-ranging and interrelated decisions so\nthey must be able to rely on imaginative teams who comprehend the conditions, foresee outcomes of many\ncourses of action, and identify key information requirements.\n10-35. As strategic leaders build and use effective staffs, they continually seek honest, competent people\ncapable of diverse thought. They cannot afford to have teams that blindly agree with everything they say.\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 10-5",
            "Chapter 10\nStrategic leaders encourage teams to participate in open dialogue with them, discuss alternative points of\nview, and explore all facts, assumptions, and implications.\nCREATES A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n10-36. Strategic leaders influence the culture of the Army. They, like all leaders, are responsible for creating\na positive environment in which to work, where individuals can thrive and be productive. Strategic leaders,\nby personal example and critical resourcing decisions, sustain the culture and policies that encourage both\nthe individual and the Army to learn and evolve.\n10-37. Strategic leaders ensure the Army Values and the Warrior Ethos remain fundamental to the Army\u2019s\nculture. They employ culture to support vision, accomplish the mission, and improve the organization.\nOrganizational culture that endorses the Army Values should reinforce ethical climates. A healthy culture is\na powerful motivational tool. Strategic leaders use culture to guide and inspire large, diverse organizations.\n10-38. Strategic leaders are at the forefront of supporting lifelong learning across the entire Army\u2014Regular\nArmy, Reserve Components, and DA Civilians. Strategic leaders promote learning by underwriting systems\nfor studying the force and forecasting future conditions. They resource a structure that constantly reflects on\nhow the nation fights and what success requires by constantly assessing the culture and deliberately\nencouraging creativity and learning. Strategic leaders work to ensure that evolving forces have optimal\ncapability over time. Strategic leaders commission forward-looking projects because the Army is dedicated\nto learning about operations in new conditions and against evolving threats.\nDEVELOPS OTHERS\n10-39. Strategic leaders, as all leaders, have the responsibility to actively develop direct subordinates.\nStrategic leaders are the top-level stewards of the Army, caring for and managing the people, physical, and\nfinancial resources entrusted to them. Strategic leaders become enablers as they underwrite the learning,\nefforts, projects, and ideas of rising leaders. Through developing others, strategic leaders build a team of\nleaders prepared to fill critical positions in the future.\n10-40. More than a matter of following formats and structured sessions, mentoring by strategic leaders\nmeans giving the right people an intellectual boost so that they make the leap to successfully operating and\ncreatively thinking at the highest levels. Leaders speak to audiences at service schools about what happens\nat their level and share their perspectives. Today\u2019s subordinates will become the next generation of strategic\nleaders.\n10-41. Global strategic conditions in constant flux have increased the importance of building agile, honest,\nand competent staffs and command teams. Strategic leaders mold staffs and organizational teams able to\nintegrate concise, unbiased information and build networks across organizational lines. Strategic leaders\nmake wide-ranging and interrelated decisions so they must be able to rely on imaginative staff and\nsubordinate leaders who comprehend the conditions, foresee consequences of many courses of action, and\nidentify key information.\n10-42. Because they must be able to compensate for their own weaknesses, strategic leaders cannot afford\nto have staffs that blindly agree with everything they say. Strategic leaders encourage staffs to participate in\nopen and candid dialogue with them, discuss alternative points of view, and explore all facts, assumptions,\nand implications. Such dialogue, that includes inquiry and advocacy, enables strategic leaders to assess all\naspects of an issue and clarifies their vision, intent, and guidance.\nSTEWARDS THE PROFESSION\n10-43. Strategic leaders, as senior stewards of the Army, are responsible for reinforcing trust and ensuring\nthe ethical design, generation, support, and application of landpower. Strategic leaders have the greatest\ninfluence on Army policies, regulations, programs, and systems. They balance today\u2019s operational\nrequirements against tomorrow\u2019s force structure and leadership needs. Their goal is to steward the profession\nby developing a core of Army leaders with relevant competencies.\n10-6 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",
            "Strategic Leadership\nACHIEVING\n10-44. Strategic leaders organize and integrate their efforts to prepare for and achieve the goals of the Army,\njoint forces, the Nation, and organizations with which they collaborate. Their ability to get results is a function\nof how well they integrate their leader competencies. The National Security Strategy, National Defense\nStrategy, and National Military Strategy guide strategic leaders as they develop their visions. Strategic leaders\nmust define for their diverse organizations what success means. They monitor progress and results by\ndrawing on personal observations, organized review and analysis, strategic management plans, and informal\ndiscussions.\nSTRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION\n10-45. By reconciling political and economic constraints with the Army\u2019s needs, strategic leaders navigate\nto move the force forward using a combination of strategy and budget processes. They spend a great deal of\ntime obtaining and allocating resources and determining conceptual directions, especially those judged\ncritical for future strategic positioning and others necessary to prevent readiness shortfalls. They oversee the\nArmy\u2019s responsibilities under Title 10 of the United States Code.\n10-46. They ask broad questions, such as\u2014\n\uf06c What are the relationships among external organizations?\n\uf06c What are the political and social systems in which the organization and the Army must operate?\n10-47. Strategic-level plans must balance competing demands across the DOD. The fundamental\nrequirements for strategic-level planning are the same as planning at the direct and organizational levels. At\nall levels, leaders establish realistic priorities and communicate decisions. What adds complexity at the\nstrategic level is the sheer number of players and resource factors that can affect the organization.\n10-48. Because lives are precious and resources are limited, strategic leaders must make tough decisions\nabout priorities. Strategic Army priorities focus on projecting landpower. When planning for tomorrow,\nstrategic leaders consistently call on their understanding and knowledge of the budgetary process to\ndetermine which technologies will provide the capability commensurate with the cost. Visionary Army\nleaders of the 1970s and 1980s realized that superior night-fighting systems and greater standoff ranges would\nexpose fewer Soldiers to danger, yet kill more of the enemy. Those leaders committed the necessary resources\nto developing and procuring these and other superior systems. The shifts from Cold War to regional conflicts\nto counterinsurgencies within decades reinforces that the conduct of war continuously changes. Strategic\nleaders must therefore seek current information about shifting strategic conditions to determine what force\nstructure to prepare. Strategic leaders must consider\u2014\n\uf06c Who, what, and where is the next threat?\n\uf06c Will we have allies or contend alone?\n\uf06c What are our national and military goals?\n\uf06c What is the successful strategic end state?\n10-49. Strategic leaders oversee the relationships between their organizations as part of the nation\u2019s total\ndefense force and the national policy apparatus. Among their duties, strategic leaders\u2014\n\uf06c Provide military counsel in national policy forums.\n\uf06c Interpret national policy guidelines and directions.\n\uf06c Plan for and maintain military capabilities required to implement national policy.\n\uf06c Present the organization\u2019s resource requirements.\n\uf06c Develop strategies to support national objectives.\n\uf06c Bridge gaps between political decisions made as part of national strategy and the individuals and\norganizations that must carry out those decisions.\n10-50. Just as direct and organizational leaders consider sister units and support agencies, strategic leaders\nconsider and work with other Services and government agencies. Many of the Army\u2019s four-star billets are\njoint or multinational. Lieutenant generals hold similar positions on the Joint Staff, with the DOD, or in\ncombatant commands. While other strategic leaders are assigned to nominally single service organizations\n31 July 2019 ADP 6-22 10-7",
            "Chapter 10\n(such as Army Materiel Command, Forces Command, Futures Command, and Training and Doctrine\nCommand), they frequently work outside Army channels. Many DA Civilian strategic leaders hold positions\nthat require a well-rounded joint perspective.\n10-51. Creating a hybrid culture that bridges gaps between partners in multinational operations is often\ncritical for success. Strategic leaders take time to learn about their partners\u2019 cultures including political,\nsocial, and economic aspects. Cultural sensitivity and geopolitical awareness are critical tools for achieving\nresults beyond the traditional chain of command. Strategic leaders must devise Army courses of action that\nreflect national policy objectives and consider the interests of other organizations and agencies.\n10-52. Strategic leaders routinely address complexity, ambiguity, rapid change, and alignment of policies.\nThey are responsible for developing well-reasoned positions and advise the Nation\u2019s highest leaders.\nStrategic leaders seek to determine what is important now and what will be important in the future. Their\nexperience, wisdom, and conceptual abilities contribute to solid insight and sound judgment across many\nsimultaneous challenges. Strategic leaders need an acute sense of timing\u2014knowing when to accept risk and\nproceed vigorously or when to proceed incrementally, testing the waters as they go. Their insight on issues\nis strong, and they can skillfully sort relevant from irrelevant connections.\n10-53. The Army\u2019s strategic leaders recognize that as an institution, the Army experiences a nearly constant\nstate of change: processing and integrating new people, missions, technologies, equipment, and information.\nTo fulfill its mission, the Army must proactively address change. Strategic leaders anticipate change while\nshielding their organizations from unimportant distracters. Strategic leaders know that change generally\nrequires influence grounded in commitment rather than forced compliance. Many major change efforts fail\nwithout organization-wide support, so leaders must reinforce commitment consistently throughout the\norganization. While all levels of leaders lead change, strategic level leaders make the most-sweeping changes\nand ones that focus on the most distant time horizon. Strategic leaders must plan for and manage change by\u2014\n\uf06c Identifying the force capabilities necessary to accomplish the National Defense Strategy.\n\uf06c Assigning strategic and operational missions, including priorities for allocating resources.\n\uf06c Preparing plans for using military forces.\n\uf06c Creating, resourcing, and sustaining organizational systems, including requisite personnel and\nequipment resources, force modernization programs, and essential command and control systems.\n\uf06c Developing and improving doctrine and the training methods supporting doctrine implementation.\n\uf06c Planning for the second- and third-order effects of change.\n\uf06c Maintaining an effective leader development program and other human resource initiatives.\n10-54. While the highly volatile nature of the strategic conditions may tempt some strategic leaders to\nconcentrate on the short term, they cannot allow the crisis of the moment to absorb them. They must remain\nsteadfast in their responsibility to shape an organization or policies that will perform over the next ten to\ntwenty years. Strategic leaders also understand complex cause-and-effect relationships and anticipate the\nsecond- and third-order effects of their decisions throughout the organization. Planning and foresight cannot\npredict or influence all future events; therefore, strategic leaders prepare intellectually for a range of threats\nand scenarios. Strategic leaders work carefully to influence the future with the means available through the\ndiplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of national power, as well as their character,\ncompetence, and confidence.\nCONSISTENTLY ASSESSES CAPABILITIES\n10-55. To put strategic vision, concepts, and plans into reality, strategic leaders must employ reliable\nfeedback systems to monitor capabilities and adherence to values and ethics. They must assess many\nconditions to determine the success of policies, operations, and vision. Other assessment efforts involve\nunderstanding the will and opinions of the Nation, expressed through law, policy, leaders, and the media.\n10-56. Strategic leaders assess a broad range of factors to gain a complete picture of progress toward goals\nand mission objectives. They rely on performance indicators to signal how well systems and processes\nbalance the imperatives of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and\nfacilities. Assessments may also include monitoring such areas as resource use, development of subordinates,\nefficiency, effects of stress and fatigue, morale, ethical considerations, and mission accomplishment.\n10-8 ADP 6-22 31 July 2019",

            "Foreword\nOur Nation\u2019s founders created a republic in which citizens of character work together to\nestablish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote\nthe general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. As a result of their vision,\ndecisions, and actions our Nation is a model of freedom and democracy throughout the\nworld.\nProtection of our way of life requires constant vigilance. Each generation inherits not\nonly the rights and privileges of being an American, but also the responsibility to defend\nthe Constitution, against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Since 1775, our Army\u2019s\nvital, enduring role has been to fight and win our Nation\u2019s wars.\nBy design, our Army has a dual nature. It is both a military department of government\nand a military profession. Both are essential to accomplish the mission. However, it is\nthe Army Profession that forges the special bond of Trust and confidence with the\nAmerican people.\nThe Army Profession is defined by its essential characteristics: Trust, Honorable Service,\nMilitary Expertise, Stewardship, and Esprit de Corps. The members of the Army\nProfession, Soldiers and Army Civilians, create and strengthen the Army culture of\nTrust.\nWe pursue a noble calling and contribute Honorable Service as a partner within the joint\ncommunity and other government services that dedicate themselves to defending the\nNation. At the same time, we are citizens whose Character, Competence, and\nCommitment exemplify the ideals espoused by the Army Ethic. In living by and\nupholding the Army Ethic, we are Trusted Army Professionals.\nRaymond T. Odierno John M. McHugh\nGeneral, U.S. Army Secretary of the Army\nChief of Staff",

It expands the discussion on the Army\u2019s dual nature as a military department of\nthe United States Government and, more importantly, a military profession. It identifies two mutually supportive\ncommunities of practice: the Profession of Arms (Soldiers) and the Army Civilian Corps (Army Civilians). It\nidentifies the essential characteristics that define the Army as a profession: trust, honorable service, military\nexpertise, stewardship, and esprit de corps. It discusses the certification criteria for Army professionals in\ncharacter, competence, and commitment. It describes the Army culture of trust and its inherent relationship with\nthe Army Ethic, the heart of the Army Profession, inspiring and motivating our shared identity as trusted Army\nprofessionals.\nThe principal audience for ADRP 1 is all members of the Army Profession. Commanders and staffs of Army\nheadquarters serving as joint task force or multinational headquarters should also refer to applicable joint or\nmultinational doctrine concerning the range of military operations and joint or multinational forces. Trainers and\neducators throughout the Army will also use this publication.

            "Introduction\nAs trusted Army professionals\u2014Soldiers and Army Civilians\u2014we are honorable servants of the Nation,\nArmy experts, and faithful stewards of the people, other resources, and profession entrusted to our care. By\nour oath, we are morally committed to support and defend the Constitution. This duty requires a foundation\nof trust with the American people, reinforced as the Army Profession contributes honorable service, military\nexpertise, and stewardship with courageous esprit de corps. Within the Army Profession, Army\nprofessionals earn and sustain trust by demonstrating character, competence, and commitment. We make\nright decisions and take right actions that are ethical, effective, and efficient.\nThis update to ADRP 1, The Army Profession, includes the expression of the Army Ethic in Chapter 2.\nADRP 1 contains seven chapters and two appendixes.\nChapter 1 discusses the nature of professions, explains why the Army is a profession, and introduces the\nessential characteristics of the Army Profession (trust, honorable service, military expertise, stewardship\nand esprit de corps).\nChapter 2 provides the doctrine on the Army Ethic, including our shared identity as Trusted Army\nProfessionals and our supporting roles as honorable servants, Army experts, and stewards of the Army\nProfession. The chapter includes discussion of the moral-principles that guide our decisions and actions in\nconduct of the mission, performance of duty, and all aspects of life.\nChapter 3 describes trust as the foundation of our relationship with the American people who rely on the\nArmy to ethically, effectively, and efficiently serve the Nation. Within the Army Profession, trust is the\norganizing principle that supports cohesive teamwork. The Army Profession develops Soldiers and Army\nCivilians to exercise mission command in honorable service in defense of the Nation.\nChapter 4 discusses honorable service, an essential characteristic of the Army Profession, as support and\ndefense of the Constitution, the American people, and the national interest in a manner consistent with the\nArmy Ethic.\nChapter 5 describes military expertise as an essential characteristic that provides ethical design,\ngeneration, support, and application of landpower, primarily in unified land operations, and all supporting\ncapabilities essential to accomplish the mission, in the right way, in defense of the American people.\nChapter 6 recognizes that stewardship, an essential characteristic, is the responsibility of Army\nProfessionals to strengthen the Army as a profession and to care for the people and resources entrusted to us\nby the American people. Stewardship provides for the long-term readiness and resilience of our people and\norganizations.\nChapter 7 provides a discussion of esprit de corps, an essential characteristic of our profession that denotes\nour collective ethos of camaraderie within cohesive teams. Esprit de corps is embedded in the Army culture\nof trust and is carried on through customs, courtesies, and traditions.\nAppendix A expands on the discussion of the Army culture.\nAppendix B restates the oaths, creeds, and norms of conduct.\nIntroductory table-1 on page viii identifies new and modified terms.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 vii",

            "Chapter 1\nThe United States Army Profession\n[We will] foster continued commitment to the Army Profession, a noble and selfless\ncalling founded on the bedrock of trust.\nChief of Staff of the Army General Raymond T. Odierno\nTHE UNITED STATES ARMY\u2014A NOBLE CALLING, A TRUSTED\nPROFESSION\n1-1. The Chief of Staff of the Army has charged all Army professionals to continue their commitment to\nmaintaining the Army as a military profession. Soldiers and Army Civilians are Army professionals,\ncertified by the profession, and bonded with comrades through shared identity, serving within our culture of\ntrust. Army professionals are stewards of the Army Profession, living by and upholding the moral principles\nof the Army Ethic. As we enter a period of strategic transition, it is our responsibility to strengthen the\nArmy Profession.\nWHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PROFESSION\u2014WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PROFESSIONAL\n1-2. A profession is a trusted, disciplined, and relatively autonomous vocation whose members\u2014\n\uf06c Provide a unique and vital service to society, without which it could not flourish.\n\uf06c Provide this service by developing and applying expert knowledge.\n\uf06c Earn the trust of society through ethical, effective, and efficient practice.\n\uf06c Establish and uphold the discipline and standards of their art and science, including the\nresponsibility for professional development and certification.\n\uf06c Are granted significant autonomy and discretion in the practice of their profession on behalf of\nsociety.\n1-3. The service provided by professions is vital to the society that establishes them. Furthermore, such\nwork is beyond the ability of the members of society to perform for themselves. Professionals continuously\ndevelop expertise and use that expertise in the best interests of the society served. The military profession,\nin particular, must provide the security\u2014the common defense\u2014which a society cannot provide for itself but\nwithout which the society cannot survive.\n1-4. Unlike bureaucracies, understood in the purest sense, professions create and work with expert\nknowledge. It is not merely routine or repetitive work; a professional\u2019s expertise is typically applied within\nnew, often unexpected situations. Professionals require years of study and practice. They normally start at\nan entry level and develop the art and science of their practice by study and experience; usually there is no\nlateral entry. Examples of traditional professions include medicine, theology, law, and the military.\n1-5. Professions earn and maintain the trust of society through ethical, effective, and efficient application\nof their expertise on society\u2019s behalf. The profession\u2019s ethic establishes the moral principles that guide the\napplication of service on behalf of society. If a profession violates its ethic and loses trust with the society it\nserves, it becomes subject to increased oversight and control.\n1-6. Professions self-regulate and guide the actions of their members and the quality of their work in\naccordance with the profession\u2019s ethic. A professional ethic reflects laws, values, and beliefs deeply\nembedded within the profession\u2019s culture. The professional ethic binds individual members together in a\ncommon moral purpose to do the right thing for the right reason in the right way. The professional ethic sets\nthe conditions to establish and maintain a meritocratic culture. It provides standards, accepted and upheld\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 1-1",
            "Chapter 1\nby all members, to sustain trust with society through the proper practice of their art. Ensuring that the ethic\nis upheld is a necessity for any profession. This is of special importance for the military profession given the\nlethality inherent in its expertise.\n1-7. A profession\u2019s ethic also serves to inspire and motivate members of the profession. Professions\nemphasize intrinsic rewards to foster commitment among their professionals\u2014the lifelong pursuit of expert\nknowledge, certification in honorable work, camaraderie with fellow professionals, and the status of\nmembership in a time-honored and respected vocation. Professionals are intrinsically motivated by the\nvalue of the service they render to society. Thus, a profession is far more than a job; it is a calling\u2014a way\nof life.\n1-8. Based on trust between the profession and the society it serves, professionals are granted autonomy (a\nhigh degree of discretion). The professional must routinely make discretionary judgments and take\nappropriate action. Think of a surgeon performing surgery in an operating room, a military leader\nconducting security operations in a combat zone, or a civilian scientist doing research in an Army\nlaboratory. All have trained for years, all are surrounded by technology, and all, as individual professionals,\nare granted autonomy to make right decisions and take right actions to contribute their service, honorably.\nTHE UNITED STATES ARMY AS A MILITARY PROFESSION\n1-9. The trust we have earned and continuously reinforce is essential for the autonomy granted by our\nsociety and our government, permitting us to exercise discretion in fulfilling our role within the defense\ncommunity. The ethical, effective, and efficient accomplishment of our mission depends on the freedom to\nexercise disciplined initiative under mission command. See figure 1-1.\n\u00a9 AUSA Meeting Photo Galleries 2015\nFigure 1-1. Trusted Army professionals\n1-10. The Army Profession is a unique vocation of experts certified in the ethical design, generation,\nsupport, and application of landpower, serving under civilian authority and entrusted to defend the\nConstitution and the rights and interests of the American people.\n1-11. An Army professional is a Soldier or Army Civilian who meets the Army Profession\u2019s\ncertification criteria in character, competence, and commitment.\n1-12. The Army Ethic is the evolving set of laws, values, and beliefs, embedded within the Army\nculture of trust that motivates and guides the conduct of Army professionals bound together in\ncommon moral purpose.\n1-2 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",
            "The United States Army Profession\n1-13. The Nation tasks the Army to do many things besides combat operations, but ultimately, as ADP 1\nstates, the primary reason the Army exists is to fight and win our Nation\u2019s wars through prompt and\nsustained land combat, as part of the joint force. The Army must always be prepared to accomplish this\nmission. Army professionals understand and accept they may give their lives and justly take the lives of\nothers to accomplish the mission. The moral implications of this realization are great and compel us to be\nclear in our understanding of what it means to be an Army professional.\n1-14. Like other professions, the Army provides for the American people what they cannot provide for\nthemselves: security and defense through the conduct of unified land operations with the other Services.\nThe Army Profession provides the United States with the landpower to prevent, shape, and win in the land\ndomain.\n1-15. The American people, through civilian authorities, grant us the autonomy to use lethal force on their\nbehalf because we have earned their trust. Thus, the Army cannot simply declare itself to be a profession;\nthe American people determine whether the Army is serving them as a trusted military profession. They will\ncontinue to regard the Army as a profession based on our ethical, effective, and efficient application of\nlandpower. As long as the American people trust Army professionals to provide for their common defense,\nthey will grant us the autonomy we need to accomplish our mission in the right way.\n1-16. The Army, like other professions, inspires and motivates its members to make right decisions and\ntake right action according to the moral principles of its ethic. The Uniform Code of Military Justice, Army\nregulations, and policies set the minimum standards for ethical conduct. Right decisions and actions are an\nexpectation based on the moral principles of the Army Ethic. The specific application of the moral\nprinciples of our ethic evolve with changes in the practice of warfare and our societal norms, but the moral\nprinciples are timeless and reflect American values as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and\nConstitution.\n1-17. Simple or strict compliance with laws and regulations rarely generates a deeper understanding of why\na standard of conduct is prescribed and is considered right and good. The Army Ethic provides the moral\ndimension that aids in understanding why we live by and uphold established moral principles.\n1-18. The Army Ethic inspires an indispensable motivating spirit for those who commit to it. This is the\nethos of the Army Ethic. Today, the Army is highly trusted by the American people. This has not always\nbeen the case, and there is no guarantee that the Army will maintain its status as a trusted military\nprofession. In fact, in the modern sense at least, the Army has not always been widely acknowledged as a\nmilitary profession.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE ARMY PROFESSION\n1-19. Our Army has a dual nature\u2014it is both a military department and a military profession. America\u2019s\nArmy was founded on 14 June 1775. Under the Constitution enacted in 1789, it became a military\ndepartment of the federal government and a hierarchical organization.\n1-20. In earlier times, the status of the Army was not as high. During the War of 1812, some Army generals\nperformed quite poorly. During the Civil War, the Union Army developed its combat leadership through\n\u201con the job training.\u201d The poor readiness of Army units mobilized for the Spanish-American War led to\nmany reforms in the early 20th century, and generations of visionary Army leaders transformed the Army\ninto the modern profession of which we are members today.\n1-21. The first cohort to be recognized as \u201cprofessional\u201d was the Commissioned Officer Corps. It\ndeveloped a codified body of expert military knowledge in land warfare doctrine, instituted formal\nprograms of career-long military education in professional schools, and cultivated a unique military culture\ngrounded in the Army Ethic of honorable service to the Nation. Following the war in Vietnam, the all-\nvolunteer Army began thorough professional development of all uniformed cohorts. As such, the Warrant\nOfficer Corps and the Noncommissioned Officer Corps also became professional in nature, and bonds of\ntrust between the Army and the American people were strengthened.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 1-3",
            "Chapter 1\n1-22. ADP 1 affirms:\nThe all-volunteer force is our greatest strategic asset, providing depth, versatility, and\nunmatched experience to the joint force. As the Army continues to train, develop, and\nretain adaptive leaders, it maintains a combat-seasoned, all-volunteer force of\nprofessionals. The upcoming challenge is not just attracting and selecting the best\navailable candidates to be Army professionals but developing them to be as good as or\nbetter than our current professionals. During the last decade of war, commanders have\ngiven young leaders unprecedented flexibility and authority to operate effectively on the\nbattlefield. The Army will continue to build on this foundation as leaders train the force\nfor future missions by inculcating mission command in all training. Obviously, the Army\nneeds to retain high-quality combat-experienced leaders so that they, in turn, train the\nnext generation of Army professionals.\n1-23. As a military profession, our relationship with the American people is built on a foundation of trust,\ncontinuously reinforced as we contribute honorable service, demonstrate military expertise, provide faithful\nstewardship, and exhibit courageous esprit de corps. Figure 1-2 illustrates the Army Professions\u2019 essential\ncharacteristics. The Army Profession reinforces trust with the American people by demonstrating its\nessential characteristics in everything it does, every day, and in every setting where it serves.\nFigure 1-2. The foundation of trust and essential characteristics of the Army Profession\nTRUST\n1-24. The American people place special trust and confidence in the Army as a profession that considers\nhonorable service to the Nation its highest priority. Trust is the bedrock of the Army\u2019s relationship with the\nAmerican people. Our professional responsibility is to preserve this earned trust. Within the Army\nProfession, mutual trust is the organizing principle necessary to build cohesive teams. The Army\u2019s ability to\nfulfill its strategic role and discharge its responsibilities to the Nation depends on\u2014\n\uf06c Trust between Soldiers.\n\uf06c Trust between Soldiers and Leaders.\n\uf06c Trust between Soldiers and Army Civilians.\n\uf06c Trust among Soldiers, their Families, and the Army.\n\uf06c Trust between the Army and the American people.\n1-4 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",
            "The United States Army Profession\nHONORABLE SERVICE\n1-25. The Army exists as a profession for one reason: to serve the Nation by supporting and defending the\nConstitution in a way that upholds the rights and interests of the American people. This is the basis for the\nArmy Ethic, which is the heart of the Army Profession. The Army Ethic defines what it means to serve\nhonorably. Our professional responsibility is to daily contribute honorable service, living by and upholding\nthe Army Ethic in the conduct of our mission, performance of duty, and all aspects of life.\nMILITARY EXPERTISE\n1-26. As a profession, our military expertise is the ethical design, generation, support, and application of\nlandpower. This is how the Army contributes honorable service in defense of the Nation. Our professional\nresponsibility is to continually advance our expert knowledge and skills in landpower and to certify Army\nprofessionals. To sustain our expertise, the necessity of lifelong learning is accepted by all Army\nprofessionals.\nSTEWARDSHIP OF THE PROFESSION\n1-27. Stewardship is our duty to care for the people, other resources, and the profession entrusted to us by\nthe American people. Our decisions and actions must be right, both for today and for tomorrow. All Army\nprofessionals have the duty to be faithful, responsible, and accountable stewards, advancing the Army\nProfession, strengthening the Army culture of trust, and conveying the legacy we inherited from those who\nled the way. Senior leaders, the Army\u2019s senior stewards, have a special responsibility to ensure the present\nand future effectiveness of the Army.\nESPRIT DE CORPS\n1-28. To persevere and win in war and to prevail through adversity across the range of military operations\nrequires spirited, dedicated professionals bound together in a common moral purpose to honorably serve the\nNation. The Army Profession has a deep respect for its history and traditions and strives to achieve\nstandards of individual and collective excellence. Army professionals are a cohesive team where mutual\ntrust is reinforced through shared professional identity\u2014living by and upholding the Army Ethic. This\ncollective commitment fortifies esprit de corps.\nSUMMARY\n1-29. The essential characteristics\u2014trust, honorable service, military expertise, stewardship, and esprit de\ncorps\u2014identify and establish the Army as a military profession. Consistently demonstrated, the\ncharacteristics of the Army Profession reflect American values, the Army Ethic, and our approach to\naccomplishing our mission in support and defense of the Constitution.\n1-30. The Army Ethic is inherent within the Army culture of trust. It is manifest as the Army demonstrates\nits essential characteristics. It motivates and guides Army professionals within mission command, in the\nconduct of every operation, in performance of duty, and in all aspects of life. The Army Ethic is the heart of\nthe Army.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 1-5",

            "Chapter 2\nThe Army Ethic\nThe Army Ethic has to be one shared professional ethic that informs and inspires all\nmembers of the Army Profession\u2014both uniformed and Civilian\u2014to motivate and guide\ndecisions and actions to be trusted Army Professionals. \u2026 As Stewards of the Army\nProfession, senior leaders have the responsibility for embracing the Army Ethic and\ntaking it to their organizations as an on-going conversation within the profession to\nsupport and preserve the greatest land force ever fielded.\nJohn M. McHugh, Secretary of the Army\nTHE NATURE OF THE ARMY ETHIC\n2-1. The Army Ethic is the heart of the Army and the inspiration for our shared professional identity\u2014\nWho We Are \u2013 Why and How We Serve. It motivates our conduct as Army professionals, Soldiers and Army\nCivilians, who are bound together in common moral purpose to support and defend the Constitution and the\nAmerican people. Figure 2-1 illustrates the Army\u2019s seal.\nFigure 2-1. The Army\u2019s seal with motto: This We\u2019ll Defend\n2-2. The Army Ethic explains the nature of honorable service in accomplishment of the mission and\nperformance of duty. It guides the Army Profession in the ethical design, generation, support, and\napplication of landpower. It establishes the standard and expectation for all to serve as stewards of the\nArmy Profession. It is expressed in our moral principles, Army Values, oaths and creeds, laws and\nregulations, and customs, courtesies, and traditions\u2014all embedded within the Army culture of trust. See\nappendix A for a discussion of Army culture. See appendix B for a discussion of oaths, creeds, and norms\nof conduct.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 2-1",
            "Chapter 2\nIMPORTANCE OF THE ARMY ETHIC\n2-3. A doctrinal ethic is critical for the Army Profession. It provides the moral basis for why our Army\nexists. It emphasizes the imperative of being an honorable leader, follower, and steward of trust with the\nAmerican people.\n2-4. Within the Army Profession, we earn and reinforce trust among Soldiers, Army Civilians, and the\nArmy Family by living the Army Ethic and consistently demonstrating our character, competence, and\ncommitment.\n2-5. As volunteer Soldiers and Army Civilians, we reflect our diverse society. This is our strength. At the\nsame time, trust requires that all of us live by and uphold common, fundamental moral principles.\nStewardship includes the duty to develop character by educating, training, and inspiring all who serve to\nadhere to, internalize, and uphold the Army Ethic as their own.\n2-6. Rapid changes in the nature of armed conflict present ethical challenges to mission accomplishment.\nThese include complexity on future battlefields, particularly within the human and cyber domain. We must\nanticipate the ethical challenges associated with this uncertainty and be guided by our Army Ethic.\nORIGINS OF THE ARMY ETHIC\n2-7. Our Army Ethic has its origins in the philosophical heritage, theological and cultural traditions, and\nthe historical legacy that frame our Nation. We respect \u201cLife, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,\u201d self-\nevident truths expressed in the Declaration of Independence as American values and universal rights. These\nprinciples are enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution and our Bill of Rights.\nWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish\nJustice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the\ngeneral Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do\nordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\nPreamble to the Constitution of the United States\n2-8. The framework for the Army Ethic (see table 2-1) shows the rich and varied legal and moral sources\nof its content; it reflects our national values and moral principles. By our oath of service, we commit\nourselves to these time-honored and enduring ideals.\n2-9. The legal and regulatory foundations of the Army Ethic are found in codified documents, such as the\nUnited States (U.S.) Constitution, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the U.S. Code of Federal\nRegulations. Institutionally, these and other codified parts of our ethic serve to establish the mission of the\nArmy (ADP 1 discusses the mission of the Army). Individually, in the performance of duty, Army\nprofessionals must meet and uphold these standards. They establish the minimum norms for ethical conduct.\nDeliberate failure to meet these benchmarks violates the Army Ethic and may result in legal, regulatory, or\nadministrative consequences.\n2-10. In addition to the legal foundations, the Army Ethic includes higher standards from its moral\nfoundations, such as those expressed in the Declaration of Independence. While the moral principles of the\nArmy Ethic are not law or regulation, they establish the expectations to which we aspire institutionally as a\nprofession and individually as trusted Army professionals. These are the inspirational and motivational\nfoundations for honorable service.\n2-11. Motivated by both the legal and moral foundations of the Army Ethic, Army professionals adhere to\nall applicable laws, regulations, or rules in the accomplishment of every mission, particularly in combat or\nin any application of lethal force. However, situations of uncertainty occur where the rules do not provide a\nclear, right course of action. In these cases, Army professionals base their decisions and actions on the\nmoral principles of the Army Ethic, ensuring the protection of the inalienable rights of all people. In this\nway, Army professionals live by and uphold the moral foundation of the Army Ethic and reinforce the Army\nculture of trust among fellow Army professionals and with the American people.\n2-2 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",

On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress created our Army and gave it the mission to defend what\nwould become the United States of America. The Revolutionary War produced a courageous response from\nthe American people. Following the loss of Philadelphia in 1777, the American Army under General\nGeorge Washington went into winter quarters at Valley Forge (see figure 2-2 on page 2-4). During these\ndesperate days, the Continental Army Soldiers were motivated and inspired by a common dream: liberty.\nThe price of freedom was understood and the Soldiers at Valley Forge courageously persevered.\n2-13. In the Colonial Era, Americans regarded military service as a duty of citizenship. Today\u2019s Army\nprofessionals, Soldiers and Army Civilians, maintain that tradition. We are dedicated to the Nation\u2019s\ndefense and to the moral principles and values upon which it is founded. Our shared identity proceeds from\nour shared understanding of and respect for those whose legacy we celebrate. We honor this cherished\ninheritance in our customs, courtesies, ceremonies, and traditions. Units and organizations preserve their\nstoried histories and proudly display distinctive emblems (regimental colors, crests, insignia, patches, and\nmottos). The campaign streamers on the Army flag remind us of our history of honorable service to the\nNation. These symbols recall the sacrifice and preserve the bond with those who preceded us, express who\nwe are today, and confirm our continued calling to serve. In that tradition, as stewards of the Army\nProfession, we dedicate our lives to preserve our liberty for generations to come.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 2-3",

Within the Army, internal trust is reliance on the character, competence, and commitment of\nArmy professionals to live by and uphold the Army Ethic. It serves as a vital organizing principle that\nestablishes the conditions necessary for mission command. Trust is earned and reinforced as Army\nprofessionals contribute to the mission and perform their duty, seeking and communicating the truth and\nacting with integrity.

Since the Army Ethic is the basis for our trust in internal and external relationships, Army\nprofessionals must understand the source of their ethic and how it guides decisions and actions. Army\nprofessionals use lethal force in conditions of moral complexity common to unified land operations. This\nrequires Army professionals to adhere to the Army Ethic in the conduct of the mission, performance of\nduty, and all aspects of life. The Army Ethic is an integrated and coherent whole. It may be discussed in\nsegments or in part for instructional purposes, but altogether it applies to what an Army professional is and\ndoes, everywhere, always.\nWHY AND HOW WE SERVE\n3-10. Understanding why and how we serve the American people is a functional imperative. Army\nprofessionals understand that their honorable service is noble and just. Otherwise, they may doubt the value\nof their service or question their commitment to the Army Profession.\n3-11. Adherence to the Army Ethic, a moral obligation, is a force multiplier in all operations. Leaders are\nrole models and must communicate and set the example for living the Army Ethic for their Soldiers and\nArmy Civilians. By living and upholding the Army Ethic, we strengthen the essential characteristics of the\nArmy Profession.\n3-12. In support of the Constitution, Title 10, United States Code is the legal foundation for the Armed\nForces of the United States. Our oath to support and defend the Constitution is a moral obligation to protect\nthe American people and the inalienable rights expressed in the Declaration of Independence. This is the\nhonorable service that the Army Profession provides to the Nation.\n3-13. The Army defends the security and integrity of the United States as a sovereign nation. It protects the\nrights and interests of the American people by conducting military operations as directed by civilian leaders\nin a manner that also respects the basic rights of others.\n3-14. The Nation\u2019s political sovereignty is a collective responsibility of the American people. As their\ntrusted guardians, we restrain our actions and fight with virtue, respecting the inalienable rights of all\npeople. If we are to maintain legitimacy as a profession while protecting the interests of the American\npeople, we cannot violate the rights of others when using lethal force to protect our own rights.\n3-15. Important insights for all Army professionals about how and why we serve include the following:\n\uf06c The collective right of the American people to independence and political sovereignty is the\nmoral basis for the Army mission.\n\uf06c Protecting our collective right is the service the Army Profession provides for our society.\n\uf06c As Army professionals, we must not violate the rights of others, or we violate our own ethic and\nerode trust and legitimacy.\n\uf06c The Army mission, as directed by our civilian leaders, justifies the ethical application of\nlandpower.\n\uf06c The moral justification for the Army mission is the basis for taking the lives of others and\ncourageously placing our own lives at risk.\n3-16. Army professionals understand that they are part of the institution that protects the Constitutional\nrights of every American. Therefore, any failure to respect basic rights and adhere to the law of war\ndiminishes the trust of the American people and the respect of the international community. Such failure can\ncause great harm to the legitimacy of our profession and our Nation.\nTHE ARMY ETHIC AND THE APPLICATION OF FORCE\n3-17. With ongoing change in the world balance of power and rapid advances in technology, the Army\nProfession\u2019s practice of warfare continuously evolves.

            "Trust\u2014The Bedrock of Our Profession\n3-18. At the strategic level, senior Army leaders address ends, ways, and means to accomplish our global\nmission. Our ethic provides strategic leaders with moral guidance when considering prudent risk,\ndisciplined initiative, and the consequences of military operations. Tactically and operationally, Army\nleaders apply legal principles to determine how their units use lethal force. The Hague and Geneva\nConventions express the legal formulation of these principles further described in Army doctrine.\n3-19. The principle of military necessity requires combat forces to engage in only those acts essential to\nsecure a legitimate military objective. This principle justifies those measures, not forbidden by international\nlaw, necessary to accomplish the mission.\n3-20. The principle of distinction requires discrimination between lawful combatants and noncombatants.\nThe latter includes civilians, civilian property, prisoners of war, and wounded personnel who are unable to\nresist.\n3-21. The principle of proportionality states that the anticipated loss of life and damage to property\nincidental to military action must not be excessive in relation to the expected military advantage.\n3-22. The principle of unnecessary suffering requires military forces to avoid inflicting harm to people or\ndamage to property beyond that which is necessary to accomplish the mission. Tactically, this principle\nimposes restraints on Soldiers involved in close combat.\n3-23. These principles establish legal and moral boundaries for the use of landpower. They are the basis for\nthe rules of engagement and \u201cThe Soldier\u2019s Rules.\u201d These principles guide Army leaders as they plan and\nconduct the mission and protect noncombatants and their property to the maximum extent possible.\nLIVING BY AND UPHOLDING THE ARMY ETHIC\n3-24. As Soldiers and Army Civilians, we join the Army Profession with personal values developed in\nchildhood and nurtured through years of experience. By taking our oath to support and defend the\nConstitution, we agree to live by a new set of values\u2014Army Values. These values, understood as moral\nprinciples, are inherent within the Army Ethic. As Army professionals, we commit to embracing Army\nValues, living by and upholding the moral principles of the Army Ethic. The Army Ethic guides our\ndecisions and actions, always. When we uphold the Army Values and live the Army Ethic, we strengthen\nthe Army culture of trust.\n3-25. As stewards of the profession, we must lead by example and uphold the Army Ethic in all aspects of\nour lives. We are accountable, and hold others accountable, to be worthy of our status as Army\nprofessionals.\n3-26. Acts of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and hazing are examples of violations of the Army Ethic.\nThey injure our comrades, are corrosive to the Army culture of trust, and they undermine the trust of the\nAmerican people. All members of the profession are comrades. The Warrior Ethos states, \u201cI will never\nleave a fallen comrade.\u201d This applies both on and off the battlefield\u2014at all times.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 3-5",

Honorable service is support and defense of the Constitution, the American people, and the\nnational interest in a manner consistent with the Army Ethic. Throughout history, every military has\nhad a distinct ethic and ethos that reflect the values and norms of the society it protected. The moral\nprinciples of the Army Ethic encompass American values and guide our approach to warfighting.\n4-2. We contribute honorable service as we accomplish our mission, perform our duty, and live our lives\nin a manner worthy of our professional status. Doing so requires that we make right decisions and take right\naction. This requires an understanding of what is right. A right decision and action is ethical, effective, and\nefficient. In this way, living by and upholding the Army Ethic means that its moral principles are woven\nthrough all facets of our lives. Figure 4-1 shows Major Mark Bieger carrying an injured child in Mosul,\nIraq, Staff Sergeant Ryan Pitts and the Medal of Honor, and Mr. Ernest Roth receiving the Commander\u2019s\nAward for Civilian Service.\nFigure 4-1. Honorable service\n4-3. As Army professionals, we accept the responsibility to continuously develop others and ourselves in\ncharacter, competence, and commitment. These attributes, consistently demonstrated, reinforce trust. Trust\nis essential for the successful accomplishment of every mission and endeavor. Thus, we aspire to be trusted\nArmy professionals.\n4-4. Conversely, misconduct undermines trust and can bring discredit on us all. Moral failure\ncompromises the Army Profession\u2019s bond of trust among its members, with the American people, and with\nthe international community. It is our duty to set the example, to prevent misconduct, and to do what is right\nto stop unethical practices.\n4-5. Our identity is strengthened through education, training, and experience. We are committed to\nlifelong learning and character development, offering and receiving coaching, counseling, and mentoring.\nWe strive for excellence in all endeavors and set the example for what it means to live by and uphold the\nArmy Ethic.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 4-1",
            "Chapter 4\nHONORABLE SERVICE, CIVILIAN AUTHORITY, AND OUR\nCONSTITUTIONAL OATHS\n4-6. Honorable service to the Nation demands true faith and allegiance to the Constitution. The Oath of\nOffice (commissioning) for officers, the Oath of Enlistment for enlisted Soldiers, and the Oath of Office for\nArmy Civilians each share these words: \u201cthat I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States\nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\u201d\n4-7. Our military responsibility is conferred by the American people, based on the principles of the\nDeclaration of Independence, through the Constitution, and law, such as Titles 5, 10, and 32 of the United\nStates Code. Military authority is delegated by elected and appointed public officials to the Soldiers and\nArmy Civilians entrusted with executing their orders. The Oath of Enlistment obliges obedience to the\norders of superior officers, and the Oath of Office implies the same for commissioned officers and Army\nCivilians. The Army Professional\u2019s oath requires strict adherence to the law. No order can set aside this\nobligation.\n4-8. The Army professional\u2019s moral awareness and sensitivity is required for legally and morally\njustifiable action. General George Washington exemplified honorable service in his resignation to Congress\nat the close of the Revolutionary War. By this act, he ensured that his immense national popularity as a\nmilitary leader and hero would not overshadow the necessary exercise of power of the fledgling Congress.\nThus, the American military has long recognized and embraced a moral tradition of subordination to elected\ncivilian authority within honorable service to country.\nUpholding the Army Ethic\nPFC Justin Watt\u2019s decisions and actions demonstrate the courage that is required\nto do what is right despite risk, uncertainty, and fear. In March 2006 near\nMahmudiyah, Iraq, four Soldiers raped a 14-year old Iraqi girl and murdered her and\nher family. After learning of these acts, despite imminent risk of retaliation, a member\nof their platoon, PFC Watt, reported the incident to his chain of command. Ultimately,\nall four Soldiers were tried and convicted.\nPFC Watt stated, \u201cIf you have the power to make something right, you should do\nit. Investigation is not my job. But if something went down\u2014something terrible like\nthat\u2014then it\u2019s my obligation to come forward.\u201d His commitment to uphold the Army\nEthic at the risk of his own life exemplifies honorable service.\n4-9. Soldiers in combat operations balance between the necessity to obey their superiors without hesitation\nand the legality and morality of using violence in the service of the Nation. The law is explicit. Soldiers are\nlegally bound to obey the orders of their superiors but they must disobey an unlawful order. Soldiers are\nalso legally bound to report violations of the law of war to their chain of command. The honorable action of\nPFC Justin Watt in reporting, contrary to instructions, the misconduct at Mahmudiyah is one such example.\n4-10. Often there is no time for recourse to legal advice in combat. Soldiers then act in accordance with\ntheir training. Realistic training should expose them to potential dilemmas and leaders must emphasize the\nprimacy of \u201cThe Soldier\u2019s Rules.\u201d However, this may not be sufficient preparation for the realities of close\ncombat. Ethical dilemmas will occur and blind obedience is no guide to action. Thus, Soldiers inculcate the\nArmy Ethic through force of habit and the daily example of their leaders.\nETHICAL ORDERS\n4-11. Making a right choice and acting on it when faced with an ethical question can be difficult.\nSometimes it means standing firm and disagreeing with leadership on ethical grounds. These occasions test\ncharacter. Situations in which a Soldier or Army Civilian believes an order is unlawful can be most difficult.\n4-2 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",
            "Honorable Service\u2014Our Noble Calling\n4-12. Under normal circumstances, we execute a superior\u2019s decision with enthusiasm. If we perceive that an\norder is unlawful, we should seek to gain situational understanding regarding the order and its original\nintent. This may include asking for clarification from the person who issued the order before proceeding.\n4-13. If the question is complex, the Soldier or Army Civilian should seek legal counsel. If circumstances\ndo not permit, as may happen in the heat of combat, Soldiers make the best judgment possible based on\ntheir understanding of the Army Ethic as applied to the immediate situation. There is a risk when we\ndisobey what is discerned to be an unlawful order, but it may be the most courageous decision we ever\nmake.\n4-14. While none of us can be completely prepared for complex, ambiguous situations, we should reflect on\nthe Army Ethic, study lessons learned, and anticipate ethical challenges. It is expected that Soldiers and\nArmy Civilians, as trusted Army professionals, will do what they believe is right.\n4-15. By our oath of service, a public moral commitment, we voluntarily agree to live our lives, even at the\nrisk of injury or death, in honorable service to the American people. With this oath, we express our\nwillingness, as President Lincoln stated at Gettysburg, to offer our \u201clast full measure of devotion.\u201d\nIt was the honor of my life to answer the call and serve our country. \u2026 I saw the greatest\nmen I\u2019ve ever known \u2026 who placed themselves between us and the enemy to protect and\ndefend. \u2026 They\u2019re the real heroes and it is their names you should know: \u2026 No one man\ncarried the fight.

Military expertise is the ethical design, generation, support, and application of landpower,\nprimarily in unified land operations, and all supporting capabilities essential to accomplish the\nmission in defense of the American people. Soldiers and Army Civilians will find within this definition\nthe role their units and organizations play in ultimately applying landpower and how their own contribution\nfits into the larger mission.\n5-2. It takes years of study and practice to apply our military expertise in the conduct of our various\nmissions. The Army Profession has three critical tasks:\n\uf06c Develop expert knowledge.\n\uf06c Apply military expertise.\n\uf06c Certify Army professionals and organizations.\nOUR FIRST TASK\u2014DEVELOP EXPERT KNOWLEDGE\n5-3. The Army professional must develop expert knowledge in four fields:\n\uf06c Military-technical.\n\uf06c Moral-ethical.\n\uf06c Political-cultural.\n\uf06c Leader-human development.\n5-4. The military-technical field includes knowledge and application of Army force design, force\ngeneration, and the effective use of landpower. This field includes the integration of technology in the\nconduct of military operations (see figure 5-1).\n5-5. The moral-ethical field addresses knowledge and application of landpower, which is often lethal,\naccording to the American people\u2019s expectations and values. This field encompasses the legal and moral\ncontents of the Army Ethic and their application by various methods of moral reasoning and decision\nmaking. The moral-ethical field includes shared beliefs, rules, and standards that guide us in the conduct of\nthe mission, performance of duty, and all aspects of life. These are passed along from generation to\ngeneration and apply in war and peace.\n5-6. The political-cultural field includes knowledge of how Army professionals and their organizations\ninteract outside the Army, particularly with unified action partners and civilian populations, both foreign\nand domestic, in all civil-military relations.\n5-7. The leader-human development field informs how the Army Profession inspires American citizens to\nvolunteer and accept a calling to honorable service that develops their professional identity and certifies\nthem in character, competence, and commitment. Professional development for Soldiers and Army Civilians\nis a career-long process that includes education, training, and experience. Lifelong learning is expected of\nall Army professionals.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 5-1",
            "Chapter 5\nFigure 5-1. Develop expert knowledge and apply military expertise\nOUR SECOND TASK\u2014APPLY MILITARY EXPERTISE\n5-8. We apply our military expertise with the autonomy granted by the American people. Soldiers and\nArmy Civilians must contribute their best effort to accomplish the mission. To do so requires understanding\nand applying the principles of mission command as a valued member of a cohesive team\u2014developing\nmutual trust through performance of duty with discipline and to standard.\n5-9. When applying military expertise, Army professionals repetitively make discretionary judgments,\noften with high moral implications and consequences. Whether we are Soldiers or Army Civilians, in war or\npeace, we make decisions accepting prudent risk and take action with disciplined initiative under mission\ncommand. In all cases, we are guided by the moral principles of the Army Ethic.\n5-10. As trusted Army professionals, we aspire to be Army experts making right decisions and taking right\naction. However, we understand that honest mistakes and setbacks are inevitable and can be valuable\nlearning experiences, contributing to our professional development, collective wisdom, and leadership.\nOUR THIRD TASK\u2014CERTIFY ARMY PROFESSIONALS\nVolunteers are the cornerstone of our Army. It doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from\u2014the\nmoment you volunteer, you become a part of the Army Profession \u2026 a profession that\nvalues hard work, a willingness to learn, the capacity for growth and above all, the\ncourage and integrity to lead. And for this selfless service America gets in return\nenriched citizens and committed leaders to forge the strength of the nation.\nGeneral Ann E. Dunwoody\n5-2 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",
            "Military Expertise\u2014Our Application of Landpower\n5-11. Certification is verification and validation of an Army professional\u2019s character, competence,\nand commitment to fulfill responsibilities and successfully perform assigned duty with discipline and\nto standard. The Army has significant autonomy to make decisions due to its unique military expertise and\nmoral obligation to serve the best interests of the Nation. For example, Congress does not normally dictate\ndoctrine to the Army; it trusts the Army to develop it correctly. Through certification, the Army strengthens\ntrust by confirming the professional development of Soldiers and Army Civilians and the readiness of\norganizations.\n5-12. Certification in the Army has two purposes. For the Army Profession, certification demonstrates to\nthe American people that the Army is qualified to perform its expert work. For Army professionals,\ncertification also provides motivation and a sense of accomplishment. Examples include an earned rank or\ncredential, selection for a leadership assignment (see figure 5-2), or successful completion of training.\nFigure 5-2. Change of command\n5-13. The Army Profession certifies the character, competence, and commitment of its Soldiers and Army\nCivilians throughout their service. Certification methods include\u2014\n\uf06c Official promotion and evaluation systems.\n\uf06c Professional training and education within Army schools, including branch, skill, and functional\narea qualifications.\n\uf06c Centralized certifications and assignments for leadership and command positions.\n5-14. Intrinsically, character is one\u2019s true nature including identity, sense of purpose, values, virtues,\nmorals, and conscience. Character, in an operational sense, is an Army professional\u2019s dedication and\nadherence to the Army Ethic, including Army Values, as consistently and faithfully demonstrated in\ndecisions and actions.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 5-3",
            "Chapter 5\n5-15. Competence is an Army professional\u2019s demonstrated ability to successfully perform duty with\ndiscipline and to standard. Requisite competence varies based on level of responsibility (rank or grade) and\nthe duties associated with specific force structure positions within career management fields.\n5-16. Commitment is an Army professional\u2019s resolve to contribute honorable service to the Nation and\naccomplish the mission despite adversity, obstacles, and challenges. To be an Army professional is to\nanswer a calling that is much more than a job. It means to be motivated primarily by the intrinsic value of\nservice rather than material benefits such as pay and vacations. At senior levels of leadership, this includes\nresponsible stewardship of the Army Profession. Demonstrating commitment requires the resilience to cope,\nrecover, and learn from setbacks.\n5-17. Upon taking our initial oath, we voluntarily join the Army Profession as aspiring Army professionals.\nUpon completion of the appropriate requirements, we receive our initial certification (see figure 5-3). This\nis a significant first step in our development as a trusted Army professional. The responsibility for\ncontinuing development and certification is a mutual one, shared between the individual and the Army\nProfession. Army professionals undergo multiple certifications in order to assume greater responsibility or\nduty requiring advanced knowledge or skills.\nFigure 5-3. Army professional certification process\n5-18. Army professionals who are veterans of honorable service or who have retired remain members of the\nArmy Profession and continue to be valued members of the Army Family. As they transition into civilian\nlife, they serve as exemplary role models within their communities. As a \u201cSoldier for Life,\u201d each man and\nwoman carries on the traditions of the Army culture of trust, demonstrating the Army Ethic in all aspects of\ntheir lives.\n5-19. The Army Profession does not automatically certify an Army professional. Service in the Army\nProfession entails significant responsibility\u2014the ethical design, generation, support, and application of\nlandpower in honorable service of the Nation. Our military expertise is not to be taken for granted.\nMembership in the Army Profession is a privileged status that members earn through initial certification and\nprogressive re-certifications in character, competence, and commitment.\nMEMBERSHIP IN THE ARMY PROFESSION\n5-20. The Army Profession has two broad categories of professionals\u2014Soldiers and Army Civilians (see\nfigure 5-4). These professionals comprise two complementary and mutually supporting communities within\nthe Army Profession:\n\uf06c The Profession of Arms is a community within the Army Profession composed of Soldiers of\nthe Regular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve.\n\uf06c The Army Civilian Corps is a community within the Army Profession composed of civilians\nserving in the Department of the Army.\n5-4 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",

Being an Army professional starts with developing and sustaining a professional identity. Identity\nrefers to one\u2019s self-concept. Soldiers and Army Civilians first identify with being members of the Army\nProfession. Their shared identity as trusted Army professionals is progressively formed and strengthened as\nthey live by and uphold the Army Ethic as they perform their duties and accomplish the mission.\n5-22. Contractors are not members of the Army Profession; however, they provide valuable support and\naugment the capabilities of the Profession of Arms and the Army Civilian Corps. Hired under contractual\nterms for specific tasks of a specified duration, contractors provide essential skills and perform technical\nand administrative tasks that allow Army professionals to focus on their primary missions. Contractors are\nan important part of any current or future Army effort.\n5-23. The progression from civilian volunteer to certified Army professional is vital to strengthening the\nmilitary expertise of the Army Profession.

Together, these characteristics explain what it\nmeans for the Army to be a profession.\n6-2. As stewards of the Army Profession, it is our duty to strengthen these characteristics every day and in\neverything we do (see figure 6-1).

Stewardship is the responsibility of Army professionals to strengthen the Army as a profession\nand to care for the people and other resources entrusted to them by the American people. Army\nprofessionals continuously strive for excellence in the performance of duty to accomplish every mission\nethically, effectively, and efficiently. Stewardship requires that we understand our work is more than just a\njob; it is an office. We accept this sense of office when sworn in under oath; this is explicit in the oaths\ntaken by Army officers and Army Civilians (and implied in the Oath of Enlistment). These oaths conclude\nwith the language: And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am\nabout to enter.\n6-4. The office which Army professionals enter upon taking their oath is not a physical workspace; it is a\nmoral workspace. This unique workspace involves our subordination to the moral responsibilities of the\nprofession. Specifically, Army professionals are stewards of the sacred trust with the American people.\nAccountability comes with the responsibility of office\u2014the obligation that the Army must always be\nprepared to fight and win. This is what S. L. A. Marshall described as the Army\u2019s \u201cexceptional and\nunremitting responsibility.\u201d\nARMY LEADERS AS STEWARDS\n6-5. All true professions police their members and create their own professional development programs.\nThey live by their ethic and advance their expert knowledge and practical expertise, which they\ncontinuously adapt to future needs. The Army was established by Congress in 1775, but it has only matured\ninto a profession since the early twentieth century. The Army Profession will continue to mature and\nreinforce trust with the American people only if its senior leaders act as responsible stewards of the\ninstitution, our people, and our resources.\n6-6. Stewardship includes the group of strategies, policies, principles, and beliefs that pertain to the\npurposeful creation, management, and sustainment of effective landpower. Stewards have concern for the\nlasting effects of their decisions on the people and other resources entrusted to their care. Senior Army\nleaders are responsible for professional development programs and improving our institutional systems for\nthe near- and long-term. As such, senior Army leaders\u2014\n\uf06c Oversee professional education and training activities essential to organizational learning,\nincluding generating military expertise related to the ethical design, generation, support, and\napplication of landpower. They actively seek to increase the profession\u2019s body of expert\nknowledge.\n\uf06c Apply expertise in leader and human development to certify individual professionals and\norganizations.

To persevere\nand prevail in these conditions requires an intangible resilience that is at the core of our ethos.\nEsprit de Corps\nDuring the epic World War II Battle of the Bulge, the one standing order that\nGeneral Middleton gave General McAuliffe on the morning of 19 December was \u201cHold\nBastogne.\u201d By 22 December, artillery ammunition was running low and German\nforces encircled the town. There were too few medics, not enough surgical equipment\nto treat the wounded, and many nearly froze in the snow. Despite these bleak\nconditions, unit esprit and Soldier morale were still high.\nWhat may have been the biggest morale booster came with an enemy ultimatum.\nAt about noon, four uniformed Germans under a white flag entered the lines of the 2d\nBattalion, 327th Infantry Regiment. The terms of the message they carried were\nsimple: \u201cthe honorable surrender of the encircled town.\u201d This was to be accomplished\nin two hours on threat of annihilation by the massed fires of the German artillery.\nThe rest of the story has become part of American military legend: General\nMcAuliffe disdainfully answered the Germans, \u201cNuts!\u201d Colonel Harper, commander of\nthe 327th, hard pressed to translate the General\u2019s idiom, decided on \u201cGo to Hell!\u201d\nNonetheless, the 101st expected that the coming day would be extremely difficult,\nand it was\u2014but, our Soldiers held Bastogne. The staunch defense of the town\nimpeded the German advance and hastened the celebration of the Allies\u2019 victory in\nEurope.\n7-4. The Army\u2019s culture reflects the belief that the Army has always endured and will endure again. Units\nthat endure have distinctively stable cultures that shape their members\u2019 behavior, even though they are\ncomposed of many, ever changing individuals. An institution\u2019s culture generally reflects what it has found\nto be functionally effective in times of crisis. Culture goes beyond mere style. It is the spirit and soul of the\norganization, the motivational bond that makes organizations distinctive sources of identity and successful\nexperience (see figure 7-2).\nBUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF DISCIPLINE AND STANDARDS\n7-5. Discipline and standards are intrinsic within the Army culture of trust. Discipline guides our manner\nof performance. We conduct ourselves according to the discipline of our military art and science. With\ndiscipline, we choose the harder right over the easier wrong in the face of temptation, obstacles, and\nadversity. Standards establish acceptable levels of performance and achievement. As a result, Army\nprofessionals strive for standards of excellence and may take justifiable pride in their contribution of\nhonorable service on behalf of the American people.\n7-6. Some may associate discipline only with regulations and the consequences for errors in judgment and\nconduct. However, it is important to understand that our professional discipline is fundamentally about how\nwe practice our profession. Discipline is a hallmark of the Army and is the expected manner in which we\nperform our duty, striving for standards of excellence.\n7-2 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",

            "Appendix A\nThe Army Culture and the Army Ethic\nARMY CULTURE\nA-1. The essential characteristics of the Army Profession\u2014trust, honorable service, military expertise,\nstewardship, and esprit de corps\u2014and the Army Ethic are inherent within the Army culture. Our culture is\ninformed by and sustains the Army Ethic, the heart of the Army. Thus, our culture and ethic are integrated,\ninterdependent, evolving, and enduring.\nA-2. All professions, major institutions, and large organizations have distinct cultures that influence\nbehaviors and shape the identity of their members. The culture of a people generally reflects what is\nacceptable and functionally effective. Thus, culture goes beyond mere style. It is essentially how we do\nthings.\nA-3. In contrast to culture, organizational climate refers to its members\u2019 feelings and attitudes as they\ninteract within their teams. Climate is often driven by observed policies and practices, reflecting the leader\u2019s\ncharacter. A zero-defect mindset, for example, can create conditions in which individuals believe they are\nnot trusted. Unlike culture, that is deeply embedded, climate can be changed quickly, for example, by\nreplacing a toxic leader or correcting dysfunctional practices.\nASSUMPTIONS, BELIEFS AND VALUES, AND ARTIFACTS\nA-4. There are three levels within the Army culture: underlying assumptions; enduring beliefs and values;\nand the artifacts and icons associated with our customs, courtesies, and traditions.\nA-5. Our shared underlying assumptions are directly associated with the Army Ethic and its binding moral\nprinciples. Consequently, the Army Ethic is integral within the Army culture, and Army professionals\nwillingly accept their duty to live by and uphold our ethic in all aspects of life. By way of illustration, we\nassume and accept the moral principle that all people are of intrinsic dignity and worth. Accordingly, we\ntreat everyone with respect.\nA-6. Within the Army culture, our shared professional beliefs and values are published in doctrine and are\nreflected in regulations, policies, and procedures. Accordingly, the Army Ethic, with embedded Army\nValues, is taught and integrated within mission command. However, if leaders allow disconnects between\nword and deed\u2014between professed values and actual practices\u2014then they breed cynicism, compromise\nmutual trust, and degrade organizational esprit de corps and individual morale. Conversely, leader actions\nconsistent with the Army Ethic strengthen mutual trust and build cohesive teams, supporting the philosophy\nof mission command.\nA-7. Artifacts and icons are what Army professionals see, hear, and feel within the Army culture. These\ninclude\u2014\n\uf06c Language, technology, and equipment.\n\uf06c Visible symbols, such as flags and unit guidons.\n\uf06c Organizational history and traditions.\n\uf06c Chain of command pictures, representing the hierarchy of responsibility and authority.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 A-1",
            "Appendix A\nCULTURAL DIMENSIONS\nA-8. Understanding the distinct levels within Army culture\u2014assumptions, beliefs and values, and artifacts\nand icons\u2014allows leaders to strengthen each as they provide continuous stewardship of the Army\nProfession and especially as they guide the Army through transitions. In this light, leaders focus on\nreinforcing\u2014\n\uf06c Our shared professional identity.\n\uf06c Our sense of community and esprit de corps.\n\uf06c Hierarchy, responsibility, and accountability.\nA-9. Our shared professional identity as trusted Army professionals guides our decisions and actions,\ninspiring us to be honorable servants, Army experts, and responsible stewards of the Army Profession. We\nare committed to lifelong learning and professional development. We strive for standards of excellence in\nall our endeavors. We contribute our best effort to accomplish the mission and embrace a spirit of service to\nothers before self.\nA-10. Army culture reinforces a necessary sense of community\u2014the Army Family. We belong to a\nprofessional family with a shared mission, purpose, and identity. Camaraderie, in a supportive and cohesive\nteam of brothers and sisters, develops our shared identity by focusing on the team (\u201cwe\u201d) and not the\nindividual (\u201cme\u201d). Cooperation and 360-degree commitment allow task-organized units, restructured\norganizations, and newly assigned Soldiers and Army Civilians to work readily together with mutual trust as\ncohesive teams. Army professionals put the Army\u2019s interests ahead of their own and find intrinsic value in\nhonorable service.\nA-11. Hierarchy is essential within the Army as a military department of government. Hierarchy reflects\nlevels of responsibility and authority. Within this structure, Army leaders at all levels contribute to mission\naccomplishment in the right way, consistent with their superior\u2019s intent. This willing obedience to legal and\nmoral orders is essential to good order and discipline within the Army culture. Within the chain of\ncommand, mutual trust supports mission command, strengthens shared professional identity, and builds\ncohesive teams.\nA-12. These dimensions of Army culture\u2014shared identity, sense of community, and hierarchy\u2014are\nmutually supporting and reinforcing. Senior Army leaders understand the interaction among these factors,\nparticularly during transitions, and ensure each is strengthened, contributing to a ready and resilient Army,\nnow and for the future.\nA-2 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",

I am proud of the Corps of\nnoncommissioned officers and will at all times conduct myself so as to bring credit upon\nthe Corps, the military service and my country regardless of the situation in which I find\nmyself.

I am aware of my role as a\nnoncommissioned officer. I will fulfill my responsibilities inherent in that role. All\nSoldiers are entitled to outstanding leadership; I will provide that leadership.

The Army culture promotes certain norms of conduct. For example, discipline is central to its\nprofessional identity. Soldiers who manage violence under the stress and ambiguity of combat require the\nhighest level of individual and organizational discipline. Likewise, because Soldiers must face the violence\nof combat, they require the stiffening of discipline to help them perform their duty.\nB-12. Army norms of conduct also demand adherence to the laws, treaties, and conventions governing the\nconduct of war to which the United States is a party. The law of war seeks both to legitimatize and limit the\nuse of military force and prevent employing violence unnecessarily or inhumanely. For Army professionals,\nthis is more than a legal rule; it is an American value. For Americans, each individual has worth. Each is a\nperson endowed with unalienable rights.\nB-4 ADRP 1 14 June 2015",
            "Oaths, Creeds, and Norms of Conduct\nARMY VALUES\nB-13. The Army Values are inherent within the moral principles of the Army Ethic and form the basic\nmoral building blocks of an Army Professional\u2019s character. They help us judge what is right or wrong in any\nsituation.\nLoyalty\nBear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit and other\nSoldiers. Bearing true faith and allegiance is a matter of believing in and devoting\nyourself to something or someone. A loyal Soldier is one who supports the leadership and\nstands up for fellow Soldiers. By wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army you are\nexpressing your loyalty. And by doing your share, you show your loyalty to your unit.\nDuty\nFulfill your obligations. Doing your duty means more than carrying out your assigned\ntasks. Duty means being able to accomplish tasks as part of a team. The work of the U.S.\nArmy is a complex combination of missions, tasks and responsibilities \u2014 all in constant\nmotion. Our work entails building one assignment onto another. You fulfill your\nobligations as a part of your unit every time you resist the temptation to take \u201cshortcuts\u201d\nthat might undermine the integrity of the final product.\nRespect\nTreat people as they should be treated. In the Soldier\u2019s Code, we pledge to \u201ctreat others\nwith dignity and respect while expecting others to do the same.\u201d Respect is what allows\nus to appreciate the best in other people. Respect is trusting that all people have done\ntheir jobs and fulfilled their duty. And self-respect is a vital ingredient with the Army\nvalue of respect, which results from knowing you have put forth your best effort. The\nArmy is one team and each of us has something to contribute.\nSelfless Service\nPut the welfare of the nation, the Army and your subordinates before your own. Selfless\nservice is larger than just one person. In serving your country, you are doing your duty\nloyally without thought of recognition or gain. The basic building block of selfless service\nis the commitment of each team member to go a little further, endure a little longer, and\nlook a little closer to see how he or she can add to the effort.\nHonor\nLive up to Army values. The nation\u2019s highest military award is The Medal of Honor. This\naward goes to Soldiers who make honor a matter of daily living \u2014 Soldiers who develop\nthe habit of being honorable, and solidify that habit with every value choice they make.\nHonor is a matter of carrying out, acting, and living the values of respect, duty, loyalty,\nselfless service, integrity and personal courage in everything you do.\nIntegrity\nDo what\u2019s right, legally and morally. Integrity is a quality you develop by adhering to\nmoral principles. It requires that you do and say nothing that deceives others. As your\nintegrity grows, so does the trust others place in you. The more choices you make based\non integrity, the more this highly prized value will affect your relationships with family\nand friends, and, finally, the fundamental acceptance of yourself.\nPersonal Courage\nFace fear, danger or adversity (physical or moral). Personal courage has long been\nassociated with our Army. With physical courage, it is a matter of enduring physical\nduress and at times risking personal safety. Facing moral fear or adversity may be a\nlong, slow process of continuing forward on the right path, especially if taking those\nactions is not popular with others. You can build your personal courage by daily\nstanding up for and acting upon the things that you know are honorable.\n14 June 2015 ADRP 1 B-5",

Its six articles deal with a Soldier\u2019s chief concerns as an\nAmerican in combat; these concerns become critical when a Soldier must evade capture, resist while a\nprisoner, or escape from the enemy.\nArticle I: I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way\nof life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense.\nArticle II: I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never\nsurrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist.\nArticle III: If I am captured I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make\nevery effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special\nfavors from the enemy.\nArticle IV: If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners.

            "Introduction\nThis revision of Army Doctrine Reference Publication (ADRP) 1-02 compiles definitions of all Army terms\napproved for use in Army doctrinal publications, including Army doctrine publications (ADPs), Army\nDoctrine Reference Publications (ADRPs), field manuals (FMs), and Army techniques publications (ATPs).\nIt also includes joint terms appearing in the glossaries of Army doctrinal publications as of September 2015.\nADRP 1-02 also lists shortened forms (whether considered acronyms or abbreviations) approved for use in\nArmy doctrinal publications. In addition, unlike the 2013 edition of ADRP 1-02, this revision incorporates\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) terms appearing in the glossaries of Army doctrinal publications\nas of January 2014.\nThis publication is augmented by the Army Dictionary online. Changes to terminology occur more frequently\nthan traditional publication media can be updated. The terminology and symbology database, known as the\nArmy Dictionary, is updated monthly to reflect the latest editions of Army publications. (To access the\ndatabase, go to https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/index.jsp?pindex=207, and login with a common access card.) This\ndatabase is an official Department of Defense (DOD) Web site, maintained by the Combined Arms Doctrine\nDirectorate in collaboration with the Joint Staff Directorate for Joint Force Development. The site is part of\nthe Joint Doctrine, Education, and Training Electronic Information System. It includes all Army doctrinal\nterms and all military symbols in MIL-STD 2525D, including air, land, maritime, space, activities control\nmeasures, and meteorological symbols. While the database includes the same joint terms appearing in ADRP\n1-02, readers should consult Joint Publication (JP) 1-02 for up-to-date joint terminology.\nADRP 1-02 also provides a single standard for developing and depicting hand drawn and computer-generated\nmilitary symbols for situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs for all types of military\noperations. It is the Army proponent publication for all military symbols and complies with Department of\nDefense (DOD) Military Standard (MIL-STD) 2525D. The symbology chapters of this ADRP focus\nprimarily on military symbols applicable to Army land operations. When communicating instructions to\nsubordinate units, commanders and staffs from company through corps echelons should use this publication\nas a dictionary of operational terms and military symbols.\nADRP 1-02 is organized as follows:\n\uf06c Chapter 1 presents terms.\n\uf06c Chapter 2 presents acronyms, abbreviations, and country codes.\n\uf06c Chapter 3 introduces military symbology basics.\n\uf06c Chapters 4 through 7 provide icons for units, individuals, organizations, equipment, installations,\nand activities.\n\uf06c Chapter 8 introduces control measure symbols.\n\uf06c Chapter 9 discusses tactical mission tasks.\n\uf06c Chapter 10 discusses the course of action sketch.\nThe terminology entries in chapter 1 of this publication fall into three categories:\n\uf06c Definitions applicable to the Army only.\n\uf06c Joint (DOD) definitions commonly used in Army publications.\n\uf06c North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) definitions commonly used in Army publications.\nFor each term and definition, a proponent publication is cited in parentheses after the definition.\nDefinitions applicable to the Army only. The Army definition is preceded by \u201c(Army)\u201d if the term also has\na joint definition that differs from the Army definition. (See the definition for \u201cattack position\u201d listed below.)\nIf the term has no associated joint definition, the Army definition is not preceded by \u201c(Army)\u201d. (See the\ndefinition for \u201csituational understanding\u201d listed below.) All Army unique definitions must be followed by\nthe proponent Army publication in parentheses, as in the following examples:\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 vii",
            "Introduction\nattack position - (Army) The last position an attacking force occupies or passes through before\ncrossing the line of departure. (ADRP 3-90)\nsituational understanding \u2013 The product of applying analysis and judgment to relevant\ninformation to determine the relationship among the operational and mission variables to facilitate\ndecisionmaking. (ADP 5-0)\nDefinitions that are joint (DOD) and appear in the glossaries of Army publications. Each joint definition\nis preceded by \"(DOD).\" A cross-reference such as \"See ADRP X-YY\" follows the definition, signifying the\npublication discussing Army usage of the term, as in the following example:\nairspace control \u2013 (DOD) A process used to increase operational effectiveness by promoting the\nsafe, efficient, and flexible use of airspace. (JP 3-52) See ADRP 3-90, ADRP 5-0, FM 3-52, and\nFM 3-90-1.\nDefinitions that are NATO and appear in the glossaries of Army publications. Each NATO definition is\npreceded by \"(NATO).\" A cross-reference such as \"See ADRP X-YY\" follows the definition, signifying the\npublication discussing Army usage of the term, as in the following example:\nexplosive ordnance disposal incident \u2013 (NATO) The suspected or detected presence of\nunexploded explosive ordnance, or damaged explosive ordnance, which constitutes a hazard to\noperations, installations, personnel or material. Not included in this definition are the accidental\narming or other conditions that develop during the manufacture of high explosive material,\ntechnical service assembly operations or the laying of mines and demolition charges. (STANAG\n3680) See ATP 4-32.\nDOD and NATO terms with multiple definitions. The related definition number will precede the definition\nto denote the definition(s) applicable to Army doctrine. For example the DOD term \u201cdemonstration\u201d has two\ndifferent definitions (1 and 2) for this term, and the Army only uses definition number 2 in doctrine:\ndemonstration \u2013 (DOD) 2. In military deception, a show of force in an area where a decision is\nnot sought that is made to deceive an adversary. It is similar to a feint but no actual contact with\nthe adversary is intended. (JP 3-13.4) See FM 3-90-1.\nIn addition, two other descriptors may appear after a definition:\n\uf06c Also called.\n\uf06c See also.\nAlso called. If a term has a shortened form (acronym or abbreviation) approved for doctrinal use, the\nshortened form appears after the definition, preceded by also called, as in the following example:\nafter action review \u2013 A guided analysis of an organization\u2019s performance, conducted at\nappropriate times during and at the conclusion of a training event or operation with the objective\nof improving future performance. It includes a facilitator, event participants, and other observers.\nAlso called AAR. (ADRP 7-0)\nSee also. If related terms are defined elsewhere in ADRP 1-02, they are cross-referenced after the definition.\nThe related terms are bolded and preceded by \"See also,\" as in the following example:\narea security \u2013 A security task conducted to protect friendly forces, installation routes, and\nactions within a specific area. (ADRP 3-90) See also area reconnaissance, security operations,\nrear area security.\nThe acronym and abbreviation entries listed in section I of chapter 2 are Army and joint. Shortened forms\napplicable only to Army doctrine are shown in boldface, to distinguish Army from joint usage. Acronyms\nare added to ADRP 1-02 and the online \u201cArmy Dictionary\u201d when a defined term has an associated acronym\nor if an acronym has doctrinal cross branch or functional usage. The cross branch usage criterion for\nconsidering an acronym for inclusion is that it must appear in two or more doctrinal manuals that are not\nbranch specific or related.\nThe symbology chapters (chapters 3 through 10) provide detailed requirements for composing and\nconstructing symbols. The rules for building a set of military symbols allow enough flexibility for users to\nviii ADRP 1-02 7 December 2015",

Although this publication serves as the Army proponent\nfor military symbols, within DOD, MIL-STD 2525D is the proponent for military symbols. This publication\ncompiles control measure symbols. Readers can find defined terms used for symbology in chapter 1,\nincluding cross-references to publications that discuss usage of control measure symbols. All control measure\nsymbols in this publication are linked to doctrine.\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 ix",

However, due to implementation difficulties, a\n28 January 2005 memorandum from the NATO Standardization Agency declared that until STANAG 1059\ncould be fully implemented, the two-letter code would be used for the technical automated information\nsystem domain, while in all other (nontechnical) administrative areas, the three-letter code would be used.\nThe list on pages 2-26 through 2-32 provides both the two-letter and three-letter codes.\nGeographical entity Two-letter code Three-letter code\n\u2014A\u2014\nAfghanistan AF AFG\nAlbania AL ALB\nAlgeria DZ DZA\nAmerican Samoa AS ASM\nAndorra AD AND\nAngola AO AGO\nAnguilla AI AIA\nAntarctica AQ ATA\nAntigua and Barbuda AG ATG\nArgentina AR ARG\nArmenia AM ARM\nAruba AW ABW\nAustralia AU AUS\nAustria AT AUT\nAzerbaijan AZ AZE\n\u2014B\u2014\nBahamas BS BHS\nBahrain BH BHR\nBangladesh BD BGD\nBarbados BB BRB\nBelarus BY BLR\nBelize BZ BLZ\nBelgium BE BEL\nBenin BJ BEN\nBermuda BM BMU\nBhutan BT BTN\nBolivia BO BOL\nBosnia and Herzegovina BA BIH\nBotswana BW BWA\nBouvet Island BV BVT\nBrazil BR BRA\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory IO IOT\n2-26 ADRP 1-02 7 December 2015",

            "Chapter 3\nMilitary Symbology Basics\nThis chapter discusses framed symbols, locations of amplifiers, the bounding octagon,\nand the locations of icons and modifiers. It also discusses the building process for\nframed symbols and unframed symbols.\nFRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-1. A military symbol is a graphic representation of a unit, equipment, installation, activity, control\nmeasure, or tactical task relevant to military operations that is used for planning or to represent the common\noperational picture on a map, display, or overlay. Military symbols are governed by the rules in Military\nStandard (MIL-STD) 2525D. Military symbols fall into two categories: framed, which includes unit,\nequipment, installation, and activity symbols; and unframed, which includes control measure and tactical\nsymbols.\n3-2. A framed symbol is composed of a frame, color (fill), icon, modifiers, and amplifiers. Paragraphs 3-3\nthrough 3-13 discuss framed symbols.\nFRAME\n3-3. The frame is the border of a symbol. It does not include associated information inside or outside of the\nborder. The frame serves as the base to which other symbol components are added. The frame indicates the\nstandard identity, physical domain, and status of the object being represented.\nStandard Identity\n3-4. Standard identity reflects the relationship between the viewer and the operational object being\nmonitored. The standard identity categories are unknown, pending, assumed friend, friend, neutral, suspect,\nand hostile. In the realm of surface operation symbols, a circle or rectangle frame denotes friend or assumed\nfriend standard identity, a diamond frame denotes hostile or suspect standard identity, a square frame denotes\nneutral standard identity, and a quatrefoil frame denotes unknown and pending standard identity. Table 3-1\n(on page 3-2) shows frame shapes for standard identities for land symbols.\nPhysical Domain\n3-5. The physical domain defines the primary mission area for the object within the operational\nenvironment. An object can have a mission area above the earth\u2019s surface (in the air domain or space domain),\non the earth\u2019s surface, or below the earth\u2019s surface (that is, in the land domain or maritime domain). The land\ndomain includes those mission areas on the land surface or close to the surface (such as caves, mines, and\nunderground shelters). Maritime surface units are depicted in the sea surface dimension. Aircraft, regardless\nof Service ownership, are depicted in the air dimension while air facilities are depicted as land installations.\nLand equipment is depicted in the land dimension. Likewise, a landing craft whose primary mission is\nferrying personnel or equipment to and from shore are represented in the sea surface dimension. However, a\nlanding craft whose primary mission is to fight on land is a ground asset and is represented in the land\ndimension.\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 3-1",
            "Chapter 3\nTable 3-1. Frame shapes for standard identities\nStandard identity Friendly Hostile Neutral Unknown\nAssumed friend Suspect Pending\nUnit\nEquipment\nInstallation\nActivity\nStatus\n3-6. Status indicates whether an operational object exists at the location identified (status is \u201cpresent\u201d or\n\u201cconfirmed\u201d), will in the future reside at that location (status is \u201cplanned\u201d or \u201canticipated\u201d), or is thought to\nreside at that location (suspected). The symbol frame is a solid line when indicating a present status and a\ndashed line when indicating anticipated, planned, or suspected status. When the standard identity of the frame\nis uncertain, as is the case for assumed friend, suspect, or pending, the status cannot be displayed.\nAdditionally, the status cannot be shown when the symbol is unframed (equipment only) or is displayed as a\ndot. Table 3-2 shows examples of status.\n3-2 ADRP 1-02 7 December 2015",
            "Military Symbology Basics\nTable 3-2. Examples of status\nPresent Planned\nFriendly\nPresent Suspect\nHostile\nCOLOR (FILL)\n3-7. In framed symbols, color provides a redundant clue with regard to standard identity. The fill is the\ninterior area within a symbol. If color is not used, the fill is transparent. In unframed symbols (equipment),\ncolor is the sole indicator of standard identity, excluding text amplifiers. Blue for friendly or assumed friend,\nred for hostile or suspect, green for neutral, and yellow for unknown or pending are the default colors used\nto designate standard identity. Affiliation color without the fill may also be used for the frame, main icon,\nand modifiers.\nICONS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-8. The icon is the innermost part of a symbol. The icon provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric\nrepresentation of units, equipment, installations, or activities. This publication distinguishes between icons\nthat must be framed and icons for which framing is optional.\nMODIFIERS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-9. A modifier provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric representation, displayed in conjunction with\nan icon. The modifier provides additional information about the icon (unit, equipment, installation, or\nactivity) being displayed. Modifiers conform to the bounding octagon and are placed either above or below\nthe icon. This publication defines various types of modifiers and indicates where each is to be placed in\nrelation to the icon within the symbol.\nAMPLIFIERS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-10. An amplifier provides additional information about the symbol being portrayed and is displayed\noutside the frame. Figure 3-1, on page 3-4, shows the essential amplifier fields around a friendly land unit\nsymbol frame. To avoid cluttering the display, only essential amplifiers should be used. Arabic numerals are\nnormally used to show the unique designation of units. However, Roman numerals are used to show corps\nechelon units.\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 3-3",
            "Chapter 3\nFigure 3-1. New amplifier locations\n3-11. The amplifier locations in figure 3-1 are changed from previous editions of this manual. The amplifier\nlocations also vary from MIL-STD-2525D. The old amplifier locations are shown in figure 3-2. The new\namplifier locations are designed to reduce the amount of space used by a framed symbol and provide only\ncritical information around the symbol.\n3-4 ADRP 1-02 7 December 2015",

The lettering for all point, line, and\narea symbols will be oriented to the top of the display (north). In some cases the lettering may be tilted\nslightly to follow the contour of a line, but it must never be tilted so much that readers must tilt their heads\nto read it. The lettering for the bounding octagon will be the same as the orientation of the octagon. The\nlettering for the horizontal bounding octagon will be horizontal from left to right and the lettering for the\nvertical octagon will be vertical from top to bottom.\n3-6 ADRP 1-02 7 December 2015",
            "Military Symbology Basics\nTHE BOUNDING OCTAGON AND THE LOCATION OF ICONS AND\nMODIFIERS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-13. The bounding octagon serves as the spatial reference for placement of icons and modifiers within the\nframe of a symbol. It is divided into three sectors. The three sectors specify where icons and modifiers are\npositioned and how much space is available for sizing of icons and modifiers. The vertical bounding octagon\nallows for effective use of the space when dealing with vertical icons. Table 3-4 (on page 3-8) provides\nexamples showing the horizontal and vertical bounding octagons and all examples for all frame shapes.\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 3-7",

            "Military Symbology Basics\n3-14. In general, icons should not be so large as to exceed the dimensions of the main sector of the bounding\noctagon or touch the interior border of the frame. However, there are exceptions to this size rule. In those\ncases the icons will occupy the entire frame and must, therefore, exceed the dimensions of the main sector of\nthe bounding octagon and touch the interior border of the frame. These are called full-frame icons and occur\nonly in land domain symbols. Figure 3-3 shows an example of a full-frame icon for all frame shapes.\nFigure 3-3. Example of full-frame icon\nTHE BUILDING PROCESS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n3-15. Chapters 4 through 7 provide an extensive number of icons and modifiers for building a wide variety\nof framed symbols. No attempt has been made to depict all possible combinations. Instead, a standard method\nfor constructing symbols is presented. Once the user is familiar with the prescribed system, any desired\nsymbol can be developed using the logical sequence provided in this chapter. The icons shown in this\npublication are adequate for depicting all standard identities for framed symbols. When representing\nunorthodox framed symbols, users select the most appropriate icon or modifier contained herein. Soldiers\nshould avoid using any icon or modifiers or combinations and modifications that differ from those in this\npublication. If, after searching doctrinal icons and modifiers, it is necessary to create a new symbol, users\nshould explain the symbol in an accompanying legend. Computer-generated systems will have difficulty in\npassing nonstandard symbols. Table 3-5 (on page 3-10) shows the steps in the building process for framed\nsymbols.\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 3-9",

Paragraphs 3-17 through 3-21 discuss unframed symbols. Control measure symbols and mission task\nverb symbols are unframed symbols. They conform to special rules for their own elements.\nCONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n3-17. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions. Control measures may be\nboundaries, special area designations, or other unique markings related to an operational environment\u2019s\ngeometry and necessary for planning and managing operations. Control measure symbols represent control\nmeasures that can be graphically portrayed and provide operational information. They can be displayed as\npoints, lines, and areas. Control measure symbols can be combined with other military symbols, icons, and\namplifiers to display operational information. Control measure symbols follow the same basic building rules\nas framed symbols, but they are built in accordance with their template. Control measure symbols can be\nblack or white, depending on display background. Display backgrounds can be blue (for friendly), red (for\nhostile), green (for obstacles), or yellow (for a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear [CBRN]\ncontaminated area fill). Description, placement, and further details of control measure symbols are addressed\nin chapter 8. Table 3-6 (on page 3-12) shows descriptions of control measure amplifier fields. Table 3-7 (on\npage 3-13) shows the steps in the building process for control measure symbols. (See chapter 8 for more\ninformation about control measure symbols.)\nIcons for Control Measures\n3-18. The icon provides an abstract pictorial representation of the control measure. Icons can be depicted as\npoints, lines, or areas.\n3-10 ADRP 1-02 7 December 2015",
            "Military Symbology Basics\nModifiers for Control Measures\n3-19. Only chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear events and contaminated areas have modifiers.\nThe remaining control measures use amplifiers.\nAmplifiers for Control Measures\n3-20. As with the framed symbols, the amplifier in a control measure provides additional information about\nthe icon being displayed. However, the location of the amplifiers for control measures varies and is dependent\non the control measure symbol being displayed. Because the location of amplifiers varies, there is no\nstandardized amplifier placement location for all types of control measures. Chapter 8 provides numerous\nfigures and tables that identify the location of amplifiers for each of the different types of control measures.\nFor multiple entries of the same type or similar information, the field number will be followed by a dash and\na number designating the second or more uses. For example, a from-to date-time group may use 16 for the\nstart time and 16-1 for the end time, or an airspace coordination area may use 3 to name an operational name\nor designation for the airspace coordination area and use 3-1 for the unique alphanumeric designation that\nidentifies the unit establishing the airspace control area.

Weapon systems, missile launchers, and nonlethal weapons use the vertical bounding octagon and a unique\nsystem for indicating size, altitude, or range. Weapons size is indicated by a horizontal line(s) perpendicular to the\nweapon icon. If an equipment symbol has no lines, it is a basic equipment symbol. Adding one line designates it as light,\nlow altitude, or short-range. Adding two lines designates it as medium, medium altitude, or medium-range. Finally, adding\nthree lines designates it as heavy, high altitude, or long-range.

            "Chapter 8\nControl Measure Symbols\nThis chapter discusses basics, points, lines, boundary lines, areas, and abbreviations\nand acronyms for use with control measure symbols.\nBASICS OF CONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n8-1. A control measure symbol is a graphic used on maps and displays to regulate forces and warfighting\nfunctions. Definitions of terms related to control measure symbols are provided in chapter 1. The control\nmeasure symbols in this chapter are organized by the six warfighting functions: mission command, movement\nand maneuver, fires, protection, sustainment, and intelligence. Also included are airspace control measures,\nwhich are a combination of movement and maneuver, fires, and protection. Control measure symbols\ngenerally fall into one of three categories: points, lines, or areas. The coloring and labeling of control measure\nsymbols is almost identical to framed symbols.\nCOLOR OF CONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n8-2. Friendly graphic control measures are shown in black or blue. Hostile graphic control measures are\nshown in red. If red is not available, they are shown in black with the abbreviation \u201cENY\u201d placed on the\ngraphic in amplifier field 15. If a special requirement arises to show neutral or unknown graphic control\nmeasures, they are shown in black, and the abbreviations of \u201cNEU\u201d for neutral or \u201cUNK\u201d for unknown are\nused in amplifier field 15. All obstacles, regardless of standard identity, are shown in green. If green is not\navailable, obstacles should be shown using black. Yellow is used for the cross-hatching of areas with\nchemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) contamination. The use of green and yellow for\nobstacles and CBRN contamination is in contradiction to the standard identities.\nLETTERING FOR CONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n8-3. All lettering for control measure symbols must be in upper case (all capital letters). All lettering should\nbe oriented horizontally, from left to right, so readers can see it easily without having to tilt their heads. All\nlettering should be sized as large as possible, so a reader can easily understand it. However, the lettering\nshould not be so large that it interferes with other symbols or icons.\nACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS FOR CONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n8-4. Acronyms and abbreviations for use with control measure symbols are shown in this chapter and must\nbe used for Army control measure symbols. No abbreviations other than those provided in this publication\nmay be used.\nAMPLIFIER FIELDS FOR CONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n8-5. See table 3-6 (on page 3-12) for descriptions of all the amplifier fields for control measure symbols.\nFor control measures, field 3 can represent either a unique alphanumeric designation that identifies the\nestablishing unit, serviced unit, or a name, letter, or number. There is no requirement for all amplifier fields\nto be filled in for control measure symbols. Only required amplifier fields must be filled in.\nPOINT SYMBOLS\n8-6. A point is a control measure symbol that has only one set of coordinates. Most Army point symbols\nfollow a standard format. Figure 8-1 (on page 8-2) shows the composition and placement of an icon, its\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 8-1",
            "Chapter 8\nmodifiers, and its amplifiers for a standard point and a supply point. The external amplifier field 3 is used to\ndesignate the unit being serviced or another unique designation, while the internal amplifier field 3 is used to\ndesignate the unit providing the service. Point symbols cannot be rotated; therefore, text must be written\nhorizontally only (not on an angle or diagonal).\nFigure 8-1. Standard point and supply point templates\nLINE SYMBOLS\n8-7. A line is a control measure symbol with multiple sets of coordinates. Figure 8-2 shows the composition\nand placement of an icon, its modifiers, and its amplifiers for a standard line. Most lines are also labelled as\nphase lines for easy reference in orders and during transmissions. A phase line is marked as PL, with the\nline\u2019s name in field 3. When lines representing other purposes are marked as phase lines, they should show\ntheir primary purpose in the icon field (such as NFL for no fire line). The purpose of the line is labelled on\ntop of the line at both ends inside the lateral boundaries or as often as necessary for clarity. Field 3 is used\nfor fire support coordination measures, to show the designation of the controlling headquarters. The use of\nphase lines to mark line control measure symbols is not mandatory.\nFigure 8-2. Standard line template\n8-2 ADRP 1-02 7 December 2015",
            "Control Measure Symbols\nBOUNDARY LINE SYMBOLS\n8-8. A boundary is a line that delineates surface areas for the purpose of facilitating coordination and\ndeconfliction of operations between adjacent units, formations, or areas (JP 3-0). There are three types of\nboundary lines: lateral, rear, and forward. Amplifiers are displayed perpendicular to the boundary line. Figure\n8-3 shows standard horizontal (east-west) and vertical (north-south) boundary lines and the orientation of\ntheir amplifiers. The graphic for the highest echelon (field 6) unit on lateral boundaries is used for the\nboundary line. The graphic for the lower echelon (field 6) unit on a rear or forward boundary is used for the\nboundary line. When units of the same echelon are adjacent to each other, the abbreviated echelon designator\n(field 3, such as CO, BN, or BDE) can be omitted from the alphanumeric designator. Table 8-9 (on page\n8-86) provides a list of abbreviations and acronyms used in field 3. When the boundary is between units of\ndifferent countries, the three-letter country code (field 2) is shown in parentheses behind or below the unit\ndesignation.\nFigure 8-3. Horizontal and vertical boundary templates\nAREA SYMBOLS\n8-9. An area is a control measure symbol with multiple sets of coordinates that start and finish at the same\npoint. Figure 8-4 (on page 8-4) shows the composition and placement of an icon, its modifiers, and its\namplifiers for a standard area. Areas normally are marked with the abbreviation for the type of area in the\nicon field, followed by a name in field 3. This labeling should be in the center of the area unless the area is\ntoo small or the labeling would interfere with locating units. The type of area determines the number of fields\nbeing used. Not all fields are required for each area. Some areas may use only one field, while other areas\nwill use several.\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 8-3",

This chapter\nalso includes missions task verbs from STANAG 2019 (ED. 6)/APP 6(C).\nTACTICAL MISSION TASKS DEFINED\n9-1. A task is a clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by individuals or organizations. A\ntactical mission task is a specific activity performed by a unit while executing a form of tactical operation or\nform of maneuver. A tactical mission task may be expressed as either an action by a friendly force or effects\non an enemy force (FM 3-90-1). The tactical mission tasks describe the results or effects the commander\nwants to achieve.\nSYMBOLS FOR TACTICAL MISSION TASKS\n9-2. Table 9-1 (on pages 9-1 through 9-6) shows the tactical mission tasks that have symbols. Not all tactical\nmission tasks have symbols. Most of the tactical mission tasks shown in table 9-1 are defined in chapter 1.\nSome tactical mission task symbols will include unit symbols, and the tactical mission task \u201cdelay until a\nspecified time\u201d will use an amplifier. However, no modifiers are used with tactical mission task symbols.\nTactical mission task symbols are used in course of action sketches, synchronization matrixes, and maneuver\nsketches. They do not replace any part of the operation order. Tactical mission task symbols are sized to\naccommodate the scale of the display or map being used. Where practical, the tactical mission task symbol\nconnects with the task organization composition symbol centered of the left or right side of the symbol or at\nthe center of the bottom of the symbol, depending on the orientation of the symbols. Figure 9-1 (on page 9-6)\nshows an example of a tactical mission task symbol connected to task organization composition symbol.\nTable 9-1.

A course of action is a scheme developed to accomplish a mission (JP 5-0). It constitutes a broad\npotential solution to an identified problem. A course of action statement clearly portrays how the unit will\naccomplish the mission. The course of action statement should be a brief expression of how the combined\narms concept will be conducted. The course of action sketch is the graphic portrayal of the course of action\nstatement.\nMAKEUP OF COURSE OF ACTION SKETCH\n10-2. The course of action sketch provides a picture of the movement and maneuver aspects of the concept,\nincluding the positioning of forces. The course of action sketch becomes the basis for the operation overlay.\nAt a minimum, the course of action sketch includes the array of generic forces and control measures, such\nas\u2014\n\uf06c Unit and subordinate unit boundaries.\n\uf06c Unit movement formations (but not subordinate unit formations).\n\uf06c Line of departure, or line of contact and phase lines, if used.\n\uf06c Reconnaissance and security graphics.\n\uf06c Ground and air axes of advance.\n\uf06c Assembly areas, battle positions, strong points, engagement areas, and objectives.\n\uf06c Obstacle control measures and tactical mission graphics.\n\uf06c Fire support coordination and airspace control measures.\n\uf06c Main effort.\n\uf06c Location of command posts and critical information systems nodes.\n\uf06c Enemy locations, known or templated.\n\uf06c Population concentrations.\nMost symbols for use on the course of action sketch are shown in chapters 4 through 9. However, the unit\nsymbols do not provide decisionmakers with a quick and easy method of portraying detailed information\nrelating to task organization composition or combat effectiveness. Task organization composition symbols\nportray detailed information for course of action sketches.\nTASK ORGANIZATION COMPOSITION SYMBOLS\n10-3. The task organization portion of the operation order specifies the resources available to the land\nmaneuver commander in a detailed list. The headquarters and individual units of the task organization are\nportrayed graphically with unit symbols shown in chapter 4. These symbols provide a rapid and easily\nunderstood means\u2014through situation maps, overlays, and annotated aerial photographs\u2014to express an\noperation plan, concept, or friendly or hostile (enemy) situation. Figure 10-1 (on page 10-2) shows a\ncomparison of a unit symbol and task organization composition symbols.\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 10-1",
            "Chapter 10\nFigure 10-1. Comparison of sample unit and task organization composition symbols\n10-4. A task organization composition symbol is built using a rectangular frame. Figure 10-2 shows icon and\namplifier locations for task organization composition symbols (see chapter 3 for an explanation of icons and\namplifiers). Centered in the middle on the top of the frame are the echelon (field 6) and task force (field 8),\nif required. Inside the top portion of the frame, on the left side, the unique designation (field 2) of the\norganization is shown. Inside the top portion of the frame, on the right side, the combat effectiveness (field\n12) of the organization is shown. Inside the middle portion of the frame are symbols for any unit that is\nreinforced, reduced, or both (reinforced and reduced). Inside the bottom portion of the frame are symbols for\nremaining units. If no units are reinforced, reduced, or both (reinforced and reduced), then units are shown\nbelow the unique designation. If any unit is not one echelon lower than the designated unit on line 1, then the\nechelon indicator amplifier is used above the task organization unit icon (field 6). (See table 4-7 on page 4-33\nfor echelon amplifiers.) Figure 10-2 depicts sample unit and task organization composition symbols. While\nthere are four icons shown in the sample, there is no limitation as to the number of icons in a row or number\nof rows.\nFigure 10-2. Task organization composition symbol example\n10-2 ADRP 1-02 7 December 2015",
            "Course of Action Sketch\nTASK ORGANIZATION ICONS\n10-5. In all cases, task organization icons are the same as unit icons and amplifiers. Table 10-1 shows the\nmost commonly used icons and modifiers in their appropriate configurations.\nTable 10-1. Task organization icons\nFunction Symbol Function Symbol\nAir defense Field artillery\nArmor Infantry\nArmored reconnaissance (cavalry)\nNote: Reconnaissance (cavalry) unit that is Air assault infantry\nboth armored and tracked)\nAntitank Airborne infantry\nAttack helicopter Light infantry\nMechanized infantry\nAir reconnaissance (cavalry) Note: Infantry unit that is both\narmored and tracked.\nAssault or lift helicopter Medium infantry (Stryker)\nCombined arms Mountain infantry\nReconnaissance (cavalry or\nEngineer\nscout)\nCOMBAT EFFECTIVENESS ICONS\n10-6. Combat effectiveness refers to the ability of a unit to perform its mission. Factors such as ammunition,\npersonnel, status of fuel, and weapon systems availability are assessed and rated. The commander uses this\ninformation to provide a net assessment of the unit's ability to perform its mission. This assessment can then\nbe expressed graphically using combat effectiveness icons. Table 10-2 (on page 10-4) shows two sets of\ncombat effectiveness icons, which may be also used with task organization composition symbol.\n10-7. Table 10-2 depicts combat effectiveness icons for the overall combat rating of the unit in the center\ncolumn. Table 10-2 specifies combat effectiveness icons for the status of selected items of interest in the right\ncolumn. The four selected items shown in the right column are ammunition; weapons; petroleum, oils, and\nlubricants (POL); and personnel. Standard operating procedures will specify the items of interest to be\nreported. The commander may add to this list for internal reporting and tracking.\n7 December 2015 ADRP 1-02 10-3",

TC has\nexpanded to multiple platforms, users, and locations and is commonly used as a\nC2 tool. A broader audience than the end user often monitors and acts upon the\ninformation. Therefore, it is necessary to make TC abbreviations available and\nwidely distributed to educate all users. Like a brevity code, a TC abbreviation,\nprovides no security and is only meant to shorten messages, not conceal their\ncontent.\nTC does not replace formal communications. Its use must be consistent with\nexisting doctrine and established procedures. TC, like brevity codes, requires\ndiscipline to minimize ambiguity and facilitate the understanding of messages\nsent and received. Users may be joint or multinational personnel and plain\nlanguage may be the most effective means of passing information, especially\nwith new users or when giving commands. Therefore, users should avoid\ngenerating new terminology and abbreviations.\nNote:\nThis is a list of recommended acronyms, abbreviations, and terms used to\nexpedite information flow but not at the expense of clarity and accuracy of the\ninformation being sent. The list was developed by subject matter experts and\noperators of TC to streamline communications, mitigate miscommunications, and\nminimize traffic populating a chat room. Every effort should be made to use\napproved terms detailed in Service, multi-Service, and joint publications.\nTable 3.

            "Preface\nArmy Techniques Publication (ATP) 1-05.01, Religious Support and the Operations Process, provides doctrinal\nguidance on planning for religious support using the operations process. It describes the integration of religious\nsupport planning with the unit planning cycle.\nThe principle audience for ATP 1-05.01 is chaplains and chaplain assistants assigned to operational units who\ndeploy to execute decisive action. It is also applicable to Unit Ministry Teams and chaplain sections that provide\nsupport to operational units as part of their overall mission. Trainers at combat training centers and educators\nthroughout the Army will also use this publication.\nCommanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure their decisions and actions comply with applicable United States,\ninternational, and in some cases, host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure that their\nSoldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement. (See Field Manual 27-10).\nATP 1-05.01 applies to the Active Army, Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States and the\nUnited States Army Reserve, unless otherwise stated. Unless this ATP states otherwise, masculine nouns and\npronouns do not refer exclusively to men.\nThe Proponent for ATP 1-05.01 is the United States Chaplain Center and School.

            "Chapter 1\nReligious Support Planning and Unified Land Operations\nOVERVIEW\n1-1. Operational environments encompass a wide variety of conditions and circumstances. To meet the diverse\nreligious needs of deployed Soldiers, Unit Ministry Teams (UMT) and chaplain sections develop and execute an\nintegrated concept of religious support that supports the unit plan. The successful execution of the concept of\nreligious support is a result of effective mission analysis and integrated and detailed operational planning. In\norder to succeed, the UMT or chaplain section must understand the operational environment, operational\ncapabilities of the unit, its mission and its role in the larger higher headquarters mission. This analysis enables\nchaplains and chaplain assistants to execute their religious support mission more effectively.\nARMY MISSION\n1-2. The mission of the United States Army is to fight and win the Nation\u2019s wars through prompt and sustained\nland combat, as part of a joint force. The Army gives the United States landpower: the ability to gain, sustain,\nand exploit control over land, resources, and people. Soldiers accomplish missions face-to-face with people, in\nthe midst of environmental, societal, religious, and political tumult (Army Doctrinal Publication {ADP} 1). The\nArmy does this by:\n\uf06c Organizing, equipping, and training Army forces for prompt and sustained combat incident to\noperations on land\n\uf06c Integrating our capabilities with those of the other Armed Services\n\uf06c Accomplishing all missions assigned by the President, Secretary of Defense, and combatant\ncommanders\n\uf06c Remaining ready while preparing for the future\nCHAPLAIN CORPS MISSION\n1-3. The mission of the Army Chaplain Corps is to provide religious support to the Army across unified land\noperations by assisting the commander in providing for the free exercise of religion and providing religious,\nmoral, and ethical leadership through its required capabilities (provide and advise) and core competencies\n(nurture, care and honor). The Chaplain Corps does this by:\n\uf06c Organizing, equipping, supervising, and training chaplains and chaplain assistants at all echelons of\ncommand for mission success\n\uf06c Integrating the chaplain corps required capabilities (provide, advise) and core competencies (nurture,\ncare, honor) into the unit mission to sustain Soldiers and advise commanders\n\uf06c Accomplishing the religious support mission in a variety of geographical locations and operational\nmissions and at all echelons of command\n\uf06c Remaining ready while preparing for the future\n1-4. Religion impacts military operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Chaplain sections\nand UMTs develop and execute a concept of religious support by identifying the religious requirements of the\nSoldiers in the unit and analyzing the impact of the operational religious factors (physical, human, and\nideology) on the unit mission. The concept of religious support is executed in order to:\n\uf06c Provide religious support to Soldiers to include worship, sacramental ministry, religious education,\nguidance and pastoral counseling and advise the commander on the religious requirements of the\nSoldiers in the unit. Chaplains and chaplain assistants develop a concept of religious support in order\nto be present with Soldiers at critical points in the operation to provide religious leadership and\nguidance and sustain the Soldier until mission completion.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 1-1",
            "Chapter 1\n\uf06c Advise the commander and staff on the impact of religion on the execution of unit operations to\ninclude identifying the significance of indigenous religious leaders, structures, holy days and\nideologies.\n\uf06c Provide leadership to subordinate chaplains and chaplain assistants as they plan, prepare, execute and\nassess their concept of religious support.\nFor a more detailed discussion on Chaplain Corps mission, required capabilities and core competencies, see FM\n1-05.\nUNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS\n1-5. Unified action is the synchronization, coordination, and integration of the activities of governmental and\nnongovernmental entities with military operations to achieve unity of effort (Joint Publication). The foundation\nfor Army operations and its contribution to unified action is unified land operations. In unified land operations,\nthe Army seizes, retains, and exploits the initiative to gain and maintain a position of relative advantage in\nsustained land operations through decisive action. The foundations of unified land operations are decisive\naction, the Army core competencies, and mission command. For a more detailed discussion on Unified Land\nOperations, see ADP 3-0.\n1-6. Unified land operations require integrated planning and responsive execution of religious support by\nchaplain sections and UMTs at all echelons of command. Close combat against an armed adversary is an\nintense, lethal human activity. Throughout our history, chaplains and chaplain assistants have served alongside\nSoldiers, enduring the same hardships, and bearing the same burdens. Chaplains and chaplain assistants must be\nable to deliver religious support during close combat while coping with the physical, moral, and psychological\ndemands close combat places on themselves and the Soldiers they serve.\nDECISIVE ACTION\n1-7. Successful operational planning requires a thorough knowledge and application of the fundamentals of\ndecisive action. Decisive action is the continuous, simultaneous combinations of offensive, defensive, and\nstability or Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) tasks in order to prevent or deter conflict, prevail in\nwar, and create the conditions for favorable conflict resolution (ADP 3-0). Each task (offense, defense, stability\nor DSCA) has its own specific religious support requirements.\n\uf06c Operations conducted outside of the United States and its territories simultaneously combine three\ntasks \u2013 offense, defense and stability.\n\uf06c Within the United States and its territories, operations combine elements of offense, defense, and\nDSCA tasks.\nFor a more detailed discussion on decisive action, see ADP 3-0.\n1-8. Decisive action presents a unique challenge to chaplains and chaplain assistants. The continuous and\nsimultaneous execution of offensive, defensive and stability or Defense Support of Civil Authorities tasks\naffects the religious support planning, preparation and execution activities and the employment of available\nreligious support assets required for mission accomplishment. Chaplains and chaplain assistants need to conduct\nthorough mission analysis (operational environment, unit mission, Soldier religious requirements, phases of the\noperation) in order to develop a concept of religious support for each task (offensive, defensive and stability or\nDSCA) and be able to responsively adjust to transitions, ever-changing operational conditions, and diverse\nSoldier religious requirements.\nARMY CORE COMPETENCIES\n1-9. Within unified land operations are two Army core competencies: combined arms maneuver and wide\narea security. These Army core competencies are the means by which the Army executes decisive action. When\nplanning for decisive action, chaplains and chaplain assistants must understand that decisive action requires a\nweighted combination of both Army competencies. By integrating into the operations process and collaborating\nwith other members of the staff, UMTs and chaplain sections determine the religious support requirements for\nthe combined execution of the Army competencies and prioritize their religious support efforts accordingly.\n1-2 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",
            "Religious Support Planning and Unified Land Operations\n\uf06c Combined Arms Maneuver. Combined arms maneuver is the application of the elements of combat\npower in unified action to defeat enemy ground forces; to seize, occupy, and defend land areas; and\nto achieve physical, temporal, and psychological advantages over the enemy to seize and exploit the\ninitiative (ADP 3-0).\nAs an example, as part of the planning process, chaplains and chaplain assistants analyze\n\uf06e\nthe capabilities of their unit, unit mission requirements, Soldier requirements, specific religious\nsupport requirements for offensive tasks and defensive tasks and the impact of religion on unit\noperations in order to develop the concept of religious support. Analyzing the impact of religion\non the unit mission, casualty ministry, memorial ceremonies, worship opportunities, pastoral\ncounseling are more likely during this type of operation.\n\uf06c Wide Area Security. Wide area security is the application of the elements of combat power in unified\naction to protect populations, forces, infrastructure, and activities; to deny the enemy positions of\nadvantage; and to consolidate gains in order to retain the initiative (ADP 3-0).\nAs an example, as part of the planning process, chaplains and chaplain assistants analyze\n\uf06e\nthe unit mission requirements for improving civil conditions, ensuring effective governance or\ninitiating construction projects and the impact of religion on these types of unit missions.\nAnalyzing the impact of religion in the operational environment and Soldier and leader\nengagements are more likely during this type of operation.\nFor a more detailed discussion on Army core competencies, see ADP 3-0.\nMISSION COMMAND\n1-10. Mission command is the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders to\nenable disciplined initiative within the commander\u2019s intent to empower agile and adaptive leaders in the\nconduct of unified land operations (ADP 6-0). The commander is the focus of a unit\u2019s mission command\nsystem. In mission command, the commander assesses the situation, makes decisions, and directs actions. These\nactions include the arrangement of personnel, networks, information systems, processes and procedures,\nfacilities and equipment required to conduct operations (ADP 6-0). The Army executes unified land operations\nthrough decisive action by means of Army core competencies that are guided by mission command.\nCommanders integrate and synchronize operations and convey the commander\u2019s intent in order to guide the\nadaptive use of Army forces executing decisive action. Through mission orders, commanders focus on the\npurpose of the operation rather than on the details of how to perform assigned tasks. In mission command,\ncommanders:\n\uf06c Drive the operations process.\n\uf06c Develop teams.\n\uf06c Inform and Influence audiences, inside and outside of their organizations.\nFor more information on Mission Command, see ADP 6-0\n1-11. A commander\u2019s mission command system begins with people capable of adjusting to changes in the\noperational environment. As part of the commander\u2019s staff, chaplains and chaplain assistants are an essential\npart of the mission command system. Mission command requires chaplains and chaplain assistants take the\ninitiative, maintain unity of effort, take action, and act resourcefully within the commander\u2019s intent in order to\nachieve the commander\u2019s desired results as they aggressively execute the religious support mission. This\nenables chaplains and chaplain assistants to gain an understanding of the unit mission requirements and allows\nthem the greatest possible freedom of action as they plan, prepare and execute the concept of religious support.\n1-12. Leadership is critical at all levels and it is important that supervisory chaplains and chaplain assistants\nknow and understand subordinate unit missions in order to provide effective leadership and synchronize efforts.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 1-3",
            "Chapter 1\nWARFIGHTING FUNCTION\n1-13. A warfighting function is a group of tasks and systems (people, organizations, information, and\nprocesses) united by a common purpose that commanders use to accomplish missions and training objectives\n(Army Doctrinal Reference Publication (ADRP) 3-0). Warfighting functions provide organization for common\ncritical tasks. To execute combined arms operations, commanders conceptualize capabilities in terms of combat\npower. Combat power is the total means of destructive, constructive, and information capabilities that a military\nunit or formation can apply at a given time. Combat power has eight elements: leadership, information, mission\ncommand, movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection.\n1-14. The Army collectively describes the last six elements as the warfighting functions: movement and\nmaneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, mission command, and protection (ADRP 3-0). The sustainment\nwarfighting function is the related tasks and systems that provide support and services to ensure freedom of\naction, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance. The sustainment warfighting function is the provision\nof logistics, personnel services, and health service support necessary to maintain operations until successful\nmission completion. Sustainment must act, rather than react to support requirements.\n1-15. Religious support is part of the sustainment warfighting function (personnel services) and is nested across\nall other warfighting functions. Like sustainment, religious support execution must act, rather than react to\nreligious support requirements. UMTs and chaplain sections are guided by eight sustainment principles that\nimpact the execution of religious support. These principles instill confidence in commanders that religious\nsupport will be there when needed (ADRP 4-0). They are:\n\uf06c Integration. Integration is the most critical principle. Integration of religious support occurs\nthroughout the operations process (plan, prepare, execute, and assess.) One of the primary functions\nof the chaplain section or UMT is to ensure the integration and synchronization of the concept of\nreligious support with the unit\u2019s operational plan. Not properly integrating religious support and unit\noperations could result in mission failure.\n\uf06c Anticipation. Anticipation of religious support facilitates responsive support. Anticipation is the\nability to foresee events and requirements and initiate necessary actions that most appropriately\nrespond to the needs. Anticipating religious support requirements means staying abreast of\noperational plans, continuously assessing requirements, and tailoring support to meet current\noperations and the changing operational environment.\n\uf06c Responsiveness. Responsiveness is the ability to meet changing requirements on short notice and to\nrapidly sustain efforts to meet changing circumstances over time. It includes the ability to see and\nforecast operational religious support requirements that meet the needs across the area of operations.\nIt is providing the right support in the right place at the right time.\n\uf06c Simplicity. Avoiding unnecessary complexity while planning, preparing, executing, and assessing\nthe concept of religious support. Simplicity enables economy and efficiency in the use of religious\nsupport resources, while ensuring effective support of forces. Mission orders, rehearsals, battle drills,\nand standard operating procedures contribute to simplicity.\n\uf06c Economy. Economy means providing religious support resources in an efficient manner to enable a\nchaplain section or UMT to employ all assets to generate the greatest effect possible. Economy is\nachieved through efficient management, discipline, prioritization, and allocation of religious support\nresources.\n\uf06c Survivability. Survivability is the ability to protect personnel, information, infrastructure, and assets\nfrom destruction or degradation. UMTs and chaplain sections integrate survivability considerations\ninto operational planning to maximize their ability to function despite multiple threats to their safety\nand to protect Soldiers while executing the religious support mission.\n\uf06c Continuity. Continuity is the uninterrupted provision of religious support across all levels of war and\nthroughout all levels of command. Chaplains and chaplain assistants, at all levels, work hand in hand\nwith operational staffs ensuring synchronization of religious support requirements over the entire\ncourse of the operation.\n\uf06c Improvisation. Improvisation is the ability to adapt the concept of religious support to unexpected\nsituations or circumstances affecting a mission. Religious support resources are not always available\n1-4 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",

Personnel services are those sustainment functions related to Soldiers\u2019 welfare, readiness, and quality of\nlife. Personnel services complement logistics by planning for and coordinating efforts that provide and sustain\npersonnel. Religious support planning is guided by five personnel services principles:\n\uf06c Synchronization. The arrangement of actions (location of personnel, supplies, logistics) in time,\nspace and purpose to execute the religious support mission at the decisive place and time.\n\uf06c Timeliness. Timeliness ensures decision makers have access to relevant religious support and\noperational information and analysis that support current and future operations.\n\uf06c Stewardship. Stewardship is the careful and responsible management of religious support resources.\nThe Army operates under the mandate to use all available resources in the most effective and\nefficient means possible to support the Combatant Commander.\n\uf06c Accuracy. Accuracy of religious and operational information impacts the decisions made by UMTs\nand chaplain sections.\n\uf06c Consistency. Consistency involves providing uniform and compatible guidance and support to\nUMTs and chaplain sections across all levels of operations.\nFor a more detailed discussion on the sustainment warfighting function, see ADP 4-0\nOPERATIONS PROCESS\n1-17. The Army\u2019s framework for exercising mission command is the operations process: plan, prepare, execute\nand assess. Commanders are the most important participant in the operations process. They drive the operations\nprocess through the activities of understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing\noperations. Commanders and staff must act as an integrated team in order to use the operations process to\nsimultaneously plan, prepare, execute and assess operations. For more information on the operations process,\nsee ADRP 5-0.\n1-18. Chaplains and chaplain assistants must be part of the operations process (See Figure 1-1). The operations\nprocess is the overarching process that guides UMTs and chaplain sections throughout the conduct (planning,\npreparing, executing, and assessing) of operations.\nFigure 1-1. Religious support and the operations process\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 1-5",
            "Chapter 1\nRELIGIOUS SUPPORT PLANNING\n1-19. As part of the deployment, employment and redeployment process, UMTs and chaplain sections must\nplan for meeting the religious requirements of Soldiers, moving equipment, supplies and personnel throughout\nall phases of the deployment, employment and redeployment process. Religious support execution requires the\nsame level of dedicated planning as any other operational mission and is supported by the creative application\nof doctrine, tactics, techniques, procedures, supervision, personnel and resources within the commander\u2019s intent\nand planning guidance.\n1-20. The end state of religious support planning is a concept of religious support. The concept of religious\nsupport focuses on the sequence of actions (tasks) the UMT or chaplain section must execute to accomplish its\nmission. For the technical chain, a concept of religious support may outline the tasks in which subordinate or\nsupporting UMTs and chaplain sections will cooperatively accomplish to execute the overall theater religious\nsupport mission. It identifies the main and supporting efforts of the UMT or chaplain section, sustainment\nrequirements and priorities of religious support. A priority of religious support is the priority that the UMT or\nchaplain section will execute based on time or phase of the operation to ensure each unit has the required\nreligious support throughout the mission.\n1-21. One of the most important and most difficult tasks for chaplains and chaplain assistants is participating in\nand supporting unit staff planning cycles. UMTs and chaplain sections will work with command post\nintegrating cells (current operations cell, future operations cell, and plans cell), certain functional cells\n(sustainment, mission command) and various working groups to accomplish the necessary planning activities.\n(See Army Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (ATTP) 5-0.1 for more information.) By integrating into the\nunit planning process, UMTs and chaplain sections can focus on time, space and resources required to plan,\nprepare, execute and assess the concept of religious support that supports the unit plan or mission. This can\ninclude:\n\uf06c Mission, task organization, commander\u2019s concept of the operation and impact on concept of religious\nsupport\n\uf06c Time available for religious support planning, preparation and execution activities\n\uf06c Known and anticipated branch plans and sequels and impact on religious support\n\uf06c Unit locations by phase and density of personnel (to include religious census data, accommodation\nissues and other available religious support assets such as distinctive faith group leaders or\nmultinational chaplains)\n\uf06c Required planning and preparation activities (rehearsal times and locations, communication plan,\nloading required equipment)\n\uf06c Operational environment threat situation and the impact on the planning, preparation and execution\nof religious support\n\uf06c Impact of religious factors (physical, human, ideology) or humanitarian issues on unit mission\nOperational Variables\n1-22. The operational environment shapes Army operations. An operational environment is a composite of the\nconditions, circumstances, and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of\nthe commander (ADRP 3-0). Chaplains and chaplain assistants analyze the operational environment using a\nframework of eight interrelated operational variables: Political, Military, Economic, Social, Information,\nInfrastructure and Physical Environment, Time (PMESII-PT). The analysis of these variables and their\ninteractions determine the nature of an operational environment and includes the impact of the religious factors\n(physical, human and ideological) and religion on unit operations. For a more detailed discussion on religious\nsupport and the operational variables, see ATP 1-05.03: Religious Support and External Advisement.\nMission Variables\n1-23. UMTs and chaplain sections categorize relevant information from the operational variables into the\ncategories of mission variables: Mission, Enemy, Terrain and Weather, Troops and support available, Time\navailable, and Civil Considerations (METT-TC). Mission variables describe characteristics of an area of\noperations, focusing on how they might affect a mission. Using the operational variables as a source of relevant\n1-6 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",
            "Religious Support Planning and Unified Land Operations\ninformation for the mission variables allows users to refine their situational understanding of their operational\nenvironment and to visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess operations (ADRP 5-0).\n1-24. By analyzing the mission variables, chaplains and chaplain assistants refine their understanding of the\noperational environment and its impact on the religious support mission.\n\uf06c Mission. The mission is the task, together with the purpose, that clearly indicates the action to be\ntaken and the reason therefore (JP 3-0). It is always the first variable UMTs and chaplain sections\nconsider during decision-making. A mission statement defines the \"who, what, when, where, and\nwhy\" of the operation. UMTs and chaplain sections analyze the higher headquarters\u2019 warning order\nor operations order to determine how their unit contributes to the higher headquarters\u2019 mission and\nthe religious support implications. They examine the following information that affects their unit and\nreligious support mission:\nHigher headquarters\u2019 mission and commander\u2019s intent\n\uf06e\nHigher headquarters\u2019 concept of operations\n\uf06e\nSpecified, implied, and essential tasks and constraints\n\uf06e\nThe product of this part of the mission analysis is the restated mission. The restated mission is a\nsimple, concise expression of the essential tasks the unit must accomplish and the purpose to be\nachieved. The mission statement states who (the unit), what (the task), when (either the critical time\nor on order), where (location), and why (the purpose of the operation). This analysis impacts religious\nsupport planning, preparation, execution and assessment activities.\n\uf06c Enemy. In this part of mission analysis, commanders and staff continue the analysis with the enemy\nand determine how the available information applies to their operation. UMTs and chaplain sections\nidentify how the enemy may conduct operations and its implications for executing the religious\nsupport mission. For example, enemy activity may restrict travel and necessitate additional area\nsupport requirements. Analysis may also consider how religion plays a part in the enemy\u2019s capacity\nor inclination to fight.\n\uf06c Terrain and weather. An analysis of the terrain to include natural features (rivers or mountains) and\nmanmade features (cities or bridges) and weather in the operational environment is critical to mission\nsuccess. Terrain is analyzed using five military aspects: observation and fields of fire; avenues of\napproach; key and decisive terrain; obstacles; cover and concealment. Terrain characteristics impact\nthe arrangement and location of units in a given formation. Terrain, obstacles, weather extremes,\ncover, concealment, and the amount of daylight are some of the planning factors that affect the\nplanning, preparation and execution of the religious support mission. (See ATTP 5-0.1 for more\ninformation.)\n\uf06c Troops and support available. This variable includes the number, type, capabilities, and condition of\nfriendly troops and support. This includes troops attached to, or in direct support of, the unit. The\nemployment of Soldiers in the operational theater and their mission in each phase of the operation\nimpacts the preparation, planning and execution of religious support. UMTs and chaplain sections\nalso realistically determine all available resources that support the execution of religious support.\nThis can include religious support personnel, supplies, services and support from joint, host-nation,\nand unified action partners that can support the UMT or chaplain section\u2019s mission. UMTs and\nchaplain sections know the status of their subordinates, their experience and training, and their\nstrengths and weaknesses and the status of all equipment.\n\uf06c Time available. The UMT or chaplain section assess the time available for planning, preparation, and\nexecution tasks. They also understand time-space aspects to include time required to assemble,\ndeploy, move and maneuver and the impact on religious support execution.\n\uf06c Civil considerations. Civil considerations are the influence of manmade infrastructure, civilian\ninstitutions, and activities of the civilian leaders, populations, and organizations within an area of\noperations on the conduct of military operations. Civil considerations comprise six characteristics:\nareas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events. The chaplain advises the commander\nregarding religion and the impact on the mission.

The\nArmy uses three planning methodologies to assist commanders and staff:\n\uf06c Army Design Methodology\n\uf06c Military decisionmaking process\n\uf06c Troop leading procedures\nARMY DESIGN METHODOLOGY\n2-2. Army design methodology is a methodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand,\nvisualize, and describe problems and approaches to solving them (ADP 5-0). Army design methodology entails\nframing an operational environment, framing a problem, and developing an operational approach to solve the\nproblem. The understanding developed through Army design methodology continues through preparation and\nexecution in the form of continuous assessment.\n2-3. Design methodology enables UMTs and chaplain sections to understand the operational environment,\nseek to identify the right religious support problem(s) and to develop the right solutions (courses of action) to\nsolve them. Key concepts that underline the Army design methodology include:\n\uf06c Critical and creative thinking\n\uf06c Collaboration and dialogue\n\uf06c Framing\n\uf06c Narrative construction\n\uf06c Visual modeling\nFor more information on Army design methodology, see ADRP 5-0.\nMILITARY DECISIONMAKING PROCESS (MDMP)\n2-4. The military decisionmaking process is an iterative planning methodology to understand the situation and\nmission, develop a course of action, and produce an operation plan or order (ADP 5-0). This process helps the\ncommander and staff to think critically and creatively while planning. The process facilitates interaction\nbetween the commander, staff, subordinate headquarters, and other partners throughout planning. This enables\nthem to understand the situation and mission; develop and compare courses of action; decide on a course of\naction that best accomplishes the mission; and produce an operation plan or order for execution.\n2-5. Commanders initiate the military decisionmaking process upon receipt of or in anticipation of a mission.\nThe military decisionmaking process consists of seven steps. Each step has various inputs, steps to conduct and\noutputs (see Figure 2-1.) The outputs lead to an increased understanding of the situation and facilitate the next\nstep of the process. These efforts help the commander and staff understand the situation, make decisions, and\nsynchronize those decisions into a fully developed plan or order.

See ADRP 5-0 for more information on planning\npitfalls. The output of planning is a plan or order for future execution. As the operational situation changes or as\nsituational understanding improves, the plan gets refined. Planning enables the commander and staff to:\n\uf06c Understand and develop solutions to problems.\n\uf06c Anticipate events and adapt to changing conditions and circumstances.\n\uf06c Task organize the force and prioritize efforts.\n\uf06c Direct, coordinate, and synchronize actions.\n2-9. Planning begins long before a unit is alerted for deployment. Prior to any notification of a deployment,\nUMTs and chaplain sections plan for various contingencies (operational deployment, DSCA mission, regional\nalignment mission, Family and Soldier retreats, rear detachment and Family support) and hone their deployment\nskills. This can include planning in support of an upcoming combat training center rotation, forecasting required\nschools (enlisted, officer and branch specific), developing planning products required for future deployments\n(standard operating procedures, battle books, load plans, battle drills) and required personnel requirements\n(shortages, faith specific requirements). UMTs and chaplain sections conduct planning to determine operational\nand training requirements, equipment status readiness and the impact of deployment on Soldiers and Families.\n2-10. Upon receipt of an alert order or mission, planning starts a cycle of the operations process that results in a\nplan or operations order. The most valuable resource in the planning process is time. Planning activities orient\nUMTs and chaplain sections on future religious support requirements while simultaneously executing religious\nsupport requirements of current operations. Key planning considerations include:\n\uf06c Commander\u2019s intent and the concept of operations (unit mission).\n\uf06c Sustainment operations.\n\uf06c Analysis of the operational environment (operational and mission variables).\n\uf06c Chaplain Corps required capabilities (provide and advise requirements).\n2-11. Planning for UMTs and chaplain sections is the art and science of understanding a situation, envisioning a\ndesired future for religious support, and laying out effective ways of bringing about that vision through a\nconcept of religious support. The concept of religious support addresses religious support requirements in\ncurrent and future operations. It is not a script to follow, but an adaptable framework for UMTs and chaplain\nsections to execute religious support requirements. It must be flexible in order to enable UMTs and chaplain\nsections to adapt their actions to changes in the plan or operational environment. The measure is not whether\nexecution transpires as planned, but whether the framework facilitates effective action during unforeseen\nevents.\n2-12. Planning activities determine the time needed to prepare and execute the concept of religious support and\nsynchronize the execution of religious support with unit actions in time, space and purpose. Upon completion of\nthe initial order, planning activities continue as leaders revise the plan based on changing circumstances. UMTs\nand chaplain sections analyze the complex religious support requirements necessary to support the simultaneous\ncombination of offensive, defensive, stability or DSCA tasks. Activities can include:\n\uf06c Analyzing the mission to determine religious support requirements in the operational environment or\nin support of the deployment (casualty care, ramp ceremony, convoy to conduct religious services at\nremote sites or rear detachment plan).\n\uf06c Identifying all available religious support assets in the force and shortages that impact religious\nsupport execution.\n\uf06c Determining required sustainment activities (supplies, personnel, movement) at decisive points and\ntime during the operation.\n\uf06c Participating as part of the staff executing the MDMP or similar planning process or while serving as\nan advisor as part of a unit working group or cell.\n\uf06c Providing supervision for subordinate religious support planning and execution activities that impact\nthe unit mission.\n2-13. As planning activities continue, the UMT and chaplain section asks two key questions:\n\uf06c Who else needs to know?\n\uf06c Who else knows what I need to know?\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 2-3",
            "Chapter 2\nBoth questions focus on the required capabilities of the chaplain corps: provide and advise. In order to provide\nreligious support to Soldiers, UMTs and chaplain sections integrate all planning activities for preparing and\nexecuting the concept of religious support mission with the commander, key staff, subordinates and other\nrelevant personnel. The concept of religious support is not a separate activity outside of the unit\u2019s operational\nmission. Religious support is a sustaining activity that supports unit operations and Soldiers as they execute the\nunit mission. Religious support planning requires a clear understanding of commander\u2019s intent and support from\nthe unit staff, planning cells, working groups, subordinates and other personnel.\nAs a key advisor on religion, UMTs and chaplain sections have the ability to input relevant religious\ninformation into the unit planning cycle that may affect unit operations. Analysis of the religious factors\n(physical, human and ideological) and religious requirements of Soldier and coalition partners (holy days,\nworship requirements, diet) must be integrated into the planning process through planning cells, working groups\nand briefings in order to have any impact. While the UMT or chaplain section may serve as an advisor on\nreligion, other staff members or supporting sections may also have information that could provide more detailed\nanalysis of religion in the theater.\nSTANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\n2-14. A standard operating procedure establishes a standard for job performance within a unit or organization.\nIt details what is to be done, how it will be done, and who will do it. Planning activities build on already\ndeveloped standard operating procedures of the unit, higher headquarters command and chaplain supervisory\nUMTs or sections. Initially, chaplains and chaplain assistants develop most standard operating procedures while\nat home station. This enables chaplains and chaplain assistants to conduct standard operating procedure training\nand validation exercises during home station training and at combat training centers and then revise them upon\nnotification of a deployment. Chaplains and chaplain assistants may have to develop or integrate other standard\noperating procedures (higher command or theater-specific) into the battle rhythm upon entering a theater of\noperations.\nINTERNAL\n2-15. An internal standard operating procedure standardizes the internal operations within a command post, at\nan aid station, chapel or other locations and includes religious support executed during battle drills and any\nadministrative requirements. Ensure unit standard operating procedures and battle drills include notification of\nthe UMT if applicable (death of a Soldier). Supervisors ensure subordinate standard operating procedures are\ndeveloped, staffed, nested with unit standard operating procedures and battle drills and rehearsed. Internal unit\nand religious support standard operating procedures can include:\n\uf06c Organization and set-up of location within a command post or other locations to include space and\nequipment requirements and priorities of work for chaplains and chaplain assistants.\n\uf06c Staffing and shift plans and requirements for sleep plans, communication, visitation, counseling,\nmeetings, and travel.\n\uf06c Load plans, equipment checklists, maintenance requirements.\n\uf06c Briefing requirements to include operational updates, working groups, templates, commander update\nbriefs, shift-change, and synchronization meetings.\n\uf06c Battle drills with religious support specific required actions (mass casualty or death of a Soldier) and\noperational survivability requirements (protection from indirect fire, dispersion, uniform standards,\nconvoy drills, and first aid).\nEXTERNAL\n2-16. External standard operating procedures standardize interactions between supervisory chaplains and\nchaplain assistants and subordinates as it applies to executing the religious support mission in the operational\nenvironment. When possible, supervisors conduct training prior to deployment. External standard operating\nprocedures can cover:\n\uf06c Reporting requirements to include required formats, submission timelines to higher headquarters and\nmeans of delivery (See FM 6-99 for religious support report template).\n\uf06c Requirements for chaplain specific meetings and standards for religious worship, visitation, chapel\noperations or memorial and ramp ceremonies.\n2-4 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",
            "Plan\nRUNNING ESTIMATE\n2-17. A running estimate is the continuous assessment of the current situation used to determine if the current\noperation is proceeding according to the commander\u2019s intent and if planned future operations are supportable. A\nrunning estimate provides a timely, accurate evaluation of the unit, the enemy, and the area of operations at a\ngiven time. Building and continuously maintaining running estimates is a primary task of each staff section. A\ncomprehensive running estimate addresses all aspects of operations and contains both facts and assumptions\nbased on the staff\u2019s experience within a specific area of expertise.\n2-18. Chaplains and chaplain assistants use running estimates to facilitate situational understanding and support\ndecision-making during planning, preparation, execution and assessment activities. Like standard operating\nprocedures, chaplains and chaplain assistants initially develop a running estimate at home station. Upon\nnotification of a deployment to a specific theater of operations, chaplains and chaplain assistants update the\nrunning estimate based on an analysis of the operational environment and maintain it throughout the phases of\nthe operation. Upon development, the running estimate forms the base for the development of the Tab D\n(Religious Support) to Appendix 2 (Personnel Services Support) to Annex F (Sustainment) or subsequent\nfragmentary orders.\n2-19. An estimate should contain the information necessary to answer any religious support question the\ncommander poses. The estimate consists of facts, events, conclusions and recommendations on how best to use\navailable religious support resources to accomplish the mission. During planning, estimates provide key\ninformation for UMTs and chaplain sections to conduct mission analysis. During preparation, estimates\nidentify the current readiness of the UMT or chaplain section and subordinates in relationship to its religious\nsupport mission and the unit mission. During execution, information in the running estimate is incorporated into\nthe common operational picture enabling the UMT or chaplain section to depict key religious support\ninformation as it impacts current and future operations. During assessment, UMTs and chaplain sections\nanalyze new information to understand if the religious support mission is progressing according to plan. The\nassessment plan includes:\n\uf06c Religious support capabilities with respect to ongoing and planned operations.\n\uf06c Enemy capabilities and the impact on the execution of concept of religious support in current\noperations and in plans for future operations.\n\uf06c Religious factors (physical, human and ideological) and other civil considerations impacted by\nreligion.\n2-20. A comprehensive running estimate addresses all aspects of an operation based on the two chaplain corps\nrequired capabilities (provide and advise) and the three core competencies (nurture, care, and honor). This can\ninclude troop numbers (to include religious preferences) and locations, religious support assets available in\ntheater, supplies, religious holy days and movement or location of subordinate chaplains and chaplain assistants.\nFailure to maintain an up to date running estimate may lead to errors or omissions that result in the flawed\nexecution of religious support or impede the ability to offer sound religious advisement. See Appendix A for\nmore detail.\nATTACHMENT: TAB D (RELIGIOUS SUPPORT)\n2-21. The product of the military decisionmaking process is an operations order. It consists of five paragraphs:\nSituation, Mission, Execution, Sustainment, Command and Signal. Attachments to the order are information\nmanagement tools and simplify orders by providing a structure for organizing information. (See ATTP 5-0.1 for\nmore information.)\n2-22. Within the operations order, a UMT or chaplain section publishes the concept of religious support as an\nattachment: Tab D (Religious Support) to Appendix 2 (Personnel Services Support) to Annex F (Sustainment).\nThe Tab D (Religious Support) is part of the official published base order and provides planning, preparation\nand execution guidance on how UMTs and chaplain sections will provide religious support for the unit plan. It\nfollows the five-paragraph format of the base plan or order (Situation, Mission, Execution, Sustainment and\nCommand and Signal). The attachment identifies additional responsibilities or deviations from the norm. It\nshould adhere to mission command principles, focusing on \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d and giving subordinate units\nmaximum flexibility in determining \u201chow.\u201d\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 2-5",
            "Chapter 2\n2-23. Use the Tab D (Religious Support) to:\n\uf06c Describe the concept of religious support by phase or operation that meets the commander\u2019s intent.\n\uf06c Publish coordinating instructions.\n\uf06c Define religious support priorities of effort by operational phase or for each named operation.\nDetermine all area, movement or sustainment requirements that are required for the overall religious\nsupport mission.\n\uf06c Outline relevant information in other sections of the operations order (annexes, appendices and\nattachments) that increase situational understanding and mission success.\n\uf06c Identify all specified and implied tasks as they relate to religious support and the concept of religious\nsupport.\n2-24. The attachment also builds upon the unit tactical standard operating procedure and higher chaplain\nsection standard operating procedures. This reduces the amount of information required to publish the Tab D. If\nreligious support execution information is in the published tactical standard operating procedure, do not repeat it\nin the attachment. If additional religious support requirements or issues arise after the publication of the base\norder, address them in subsequent fragmentary orders. For example, the higher headquarters chaplain can\noutline operational reporting requirements (frequency, templates and information required) in the tactical\nstandard operating procedure. This enables UMTs within that command to train and prepare for future\ndeployments. If there is a change to any of the requirements while deployed, the higher headquarters UMT or\nchaplain section can use a fragmentary order to address changes. Supervisory chaplains and chaplain assistants\nensure subordinates understand the intent and any guidance requirements of the higher headquarters religious\nsupport attachment that impact the subordinate concept of religious support.\nBATTLE RHYTHM\n2-25. Battle rhythm is a deliberate daily cycle of command, staff, and unit activities intended to synchronize\ncurrent and future operations. The battle rhythm enables a unit to synchronize times and personnel for planning,\ncoordination and execution activities. The battle rhythm will change as the operation or mission changes or as\noperational conditions dictate. It can include meetings that exchange information, solve problems coordinate\naction and make decisions and working groups and boards that provide analysis, coordination and\nrecommendations.\n2-26. For UMTs and chaplain sections, a well-planned and executed battle rhythm enables them to balance the\nuse of time between critical and required planning and coordination requirements and executing the mission to\nsustain Soldiers in theater. A battle rhythm can include:\n\uf06c Worship, counseling and religious education schedule.\n\uf06c Meetings (UMT, planning and functional cells, operations synchronization, working groups, boards).\n\uf06c Briefings (operations update, commander\u2019s update, shift change).\n\uf06c Sleep schedule, visitation schedule.\n\uf06c Reporting times.\n\uf06c Work schedule in chapel, synchronization cell, command post or movement schedule.\nSITUATIONAL UNDERSTANDING\n2-27. UMTs and chaplain sections must maintain situational understanding throughout planning, preparation\nand execution activities in order to safely and comprehensively execute the concept of religious support. A\nrunning estimate is developed and continually updated to aid in situational understanding and this can include:\n\uf06c Unit boundaries and other unit locations (communications, security, unity of effort).\n\uf06c Enemy activities.\n\uf06c Weather.\n\uf06c Changes or transitions in phase or mission.\n\uf06c Task organization changes.\n\uf06c Location and movement by phase.\nUnit.\n\uf06e\n2-6 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",

Religion is an important element of all military operations. Planning determines the required religious\nrequirements necessary to sustain Soldiers during the execution of decisive action. Meeting the goal of\nproviding responsive and focused religious support relies on chaplains and chaplain assistants that have the\ntraining, collective knowledge, Army and branch specific skills and the ability to focus and apply those skills\nduring the execution of decisive action.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 2-7",

            "Chapter 3\nPrepare\nPREPARATION ACTIVITIES\n3-1. Preparation consists of those activities performed by units and Soldiers to improve their ability to execute\nan operation. Preparation creates conditions that improve friendly forces\u2019 opportunities for success. It requires\ncommander, staff, unit, and Soldier actions to ensure the force is trained, equipped, and ready to execute\noperations. Preparation activities help commanders, staffs, and Soldiers understand a situation and their roles in\nupcoming operations (ADP 5-0). Preparation activities include:\n\uf06c Coordinating with higher, lower, adjacent, supporting and supported units.\n\uf06c Conducting confirmation briefs and rehearsals.\n\uf06c Initiating troop movements and sustainment preparation.\n\uf06c Revising and refine plan.\n\uf06c Integrating new Soldiers and units.\n\uf06c Training.\n\uf06c Conducting pre-operation checks and inspections.\nFor more information, see ADRP 5-0.\n3-2. Like planning, preparation activities begin long before a unit is alerted for deployment. Prior to any\nnotification of a deployment, the UMT or chaplain section prepares for various contingencies in order to\nsupport any future deployments. This can include attending schools (enlisted, officer and branch specific),\ndeveloping deployment products (standard operating procedures, battle books, load plans, battle drills, country\nstudies and religious and Family deployment manuals), conducting military training, executing Family and\nSoldier retreats and supporting Family readiness groups. UMTs and chaplain sections conduct preparation\nactivities to ensure they are up to date on operational and training requirements, equipment is ready, required\nsupplies are ordered and packed for deployment and Families and Soldiers are prepared for future operational\ndeployments. Upon an alert, preparation focuses on the necessary activities required to deploy, execute the\nconcept of religious support while in theater and then redeploy.\n3-3. Planning and preparation can overlap as chaplains and chaplain assistants execute religious support\nrequirements while simultaneously conducting planning activities with the unit staff. Religious support\npreparation activities focus on the tasks and critical sustainment activities required to execute the Chaplain\nCorps required capabilities and core competencies. Preparation activities improve a UMT or chaplain section\u2019s\nability to execute the concept of religious support and can include:\n\uf06c Improving situational understanding on the operational environment (updating running estimates,\nanalyzing data in a portal folder or from working groups).\n\uf06c Refining the concept of religious support based on new information or change in mission.\n\uf06c Executing sustainment activities (loading equipment, personnel requests, support for specific holy\ndays, request for information or transportation).\n\uf06c Conducting inspections of UMT personnel and equipment and ensuring religious support assets are\nready and positioned (pre-combat checks, pre-combat inspections, packing for deployment or\nredeployment, opening or closing out offices).\n\uf06c Training or rehearsing religious support and Soldier tasks critical to mission success to include\npreparing survivability positions and rehearsing key battle drills (sniper, casualty, indirect fire).\n\uf06c Developing a battle rhythm to include sleep plan, required meetings (daily update briefings, shift\nchange, meetings, working groups, boards), reporting timelines and other activities that support\ncurrent and future operations.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 3-1",
            "Chapter 3\n\uf06c Integrating additional chaplains and chaplain assistants task organized into the formation (command\nrelationships, reporting requirements, support requirements and support to overall mission).\n\uf06c Conducting preparation activities for religious support execution throughout the full cycle of the\ndeployment.\n\uf06c Rehearsing the communication plan for religious support reporting using PACE: Primary, Alternate,\nContingency and Emergency.\n3-4. As preparation activities continue, the UMTs and chaplain sections continue to ask two key questions:\n\uf06c Who else needs to know?\n\uf06c Who else knows what I need to know?\nLike planning, both questions continue to focus on integrating the preparation activities with the commander,\nkey staff and other relevant personnel. This enables chaplains and chaplain assistants to prepare within the\ncommander\u2019s intent, share information with the staff and seek guidance and assistance from others that may be\nable to provide information or support for the religious support mission. The size of the operational\nenvironment and the increased dispersion of forces require both internal (unit staff sections) and external\n(higher, lower and adjacent chaplains and chaplain assistants) coordination to ensure religious support mission\nsuccess. Coordination ensures the successful execution of the religious support mission through the integration\nof the actions of multiple and interrelated religious support assets. Religious advisement supports the\ncommander and staff by analyzing the impact of the religious factors (physical, human and ideology) on the unit\nmission. As part of the sustainment warfighting function, the religious support mission requires the knowledge,\nexpertise and support of the commander, staff, other chaplains, chaplain assistants and other agencies in order to\nbe successful.\nTIME\n3-5. Time is a critical factor in all operations. UMTs and chaplain sections should take full advantage of all\nthe time available to conduct preparation activities that support the unit mission and their execution of the\nconcept of religious support. The planning process enables chaplains and chaplain assistants to determine the\ntime needed to conduct preparation activities that impact the execution of their mission. Chaplain and chaplain\nassistants prepare in order to execute a concept of religious support synchronized with unit actions in time,\nspace, and purpose and developed within the operations process. The chaplain and chaplain assistant execute\nreligious support effectively when they have a clear understanding of the context and complexities of the unit\nplan and the operational environment as it relates to time. Aspects of time include:\n\uf06c Religious support requirements synchronized with the unit mission.\n\uf06c Unit movement activities and the impact on the execution of the concept of religious support.\n\uf06c Unit mission activities (crossing line of departure; phase transitions) and the impact on religious\nsupport execution.\n\uf06c Sleep plan.\n\uf06c Meetings.\n\uf06c Reporting requirements.\n\uf06c Battle rhythm.\n\uf06c Time and culture (local culture\u2019s view of time and impact on the mission).\nREHEARSALS\n3-6. Rehearsals allow leaders and their Soldiers to practice executing key aspects of the concept of operations.\nRehearsals are the commander\u2019s tool to ensure staffs and subordinates understand the commander\u2019s intent and\nthe concept of operations. Each rehearsal type achieves a different result and has a specific place in the\npreparation timeline. The four types of rehearsals are:\n\uf06c Backbrief: A backbrief is a briefing by subordinates to the commander to review how subordinates\nintend to accomplish their mission. Supervision is a key aspect of backbriefs. Subordinate chaplains\nand chaplain assistants perform backbriefs during planning and preparation activities to keep the\ntechnical chain informed of their progress toward mission execution. This enables the technical chain\nto give guidance and support and keep the subordinate plan within the overall commander\u2019s intent.\n3-2 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",
            "Prepare\n\uf06c Combined arms rehearsal: A combined arms rehearsal is a rehearsal in which subordinate units\nsynchronize their plans with each other. This is a critical for UMTs and chaplain sections to attend.\nThis rehearsal enables UMTs and chaplain sections to synchronize their concept of religious support\nwith the unit plan and to synchronize religious support actions with each other (between battalion\nUMTs, other religious support assets and higher technical chain).\n\uf06c Sustainment rehearsal: The sustainment rehearsal helps synchronize each warfighting function with\nthe overall operation. This rehearsal supports the operation so units can accomplish their missions.\nThe sustainment rehearsal enables UMTs and chaplain sections to rehearse coordination and\nprocedures drills that impact the execution of their concept of religious support (convoy operations,\ncasualty evacuation).\n\uf06c Battle drill or SOP rehearsal: A battle drill is a collective action rapidly executed without applying a\ndeliberate decisionmaking process. A battle drill or SOP rehearsal ensures that all participants\nunderstand a technique or a specific set of procedures (wounded Soldier drill, indirect fire drill).\n3-7. After the rehearsal, the unit conducts an after action review. The unit reviews lessons learned and makes\nthe minimum required modifications to the existing plan. A rehearsal provides the final opportunity for UMTs\nand chaplain sections to identify and fix unresolved problems. (See ATTP 5-0.1 for more information.)\nSUPERVISION\n3-8. Changes in the operational environment, task organization, and the operational and mission variables\nhave an impact on preparation activities. Supervisory chaplains and chaplain assistants ensure subordinates are\nprepared to execute the concept of religious support that is integrated with the unit\u2019s concept of operations.\nThey ensure subordinate UMTs are positioned, resourced by command to meet the religious support\nrequirements, and have the ability to move and communicate. As part of their religious leader capability,\nsupervisory UMTs perform or provide pastoral support to subordinate UMTs to improve their resiliency prior to\nthe execution of their mission.\nSUMMARY\n3-9. Mission success depends as much on preparation as on planning. Preparing for the religious support\nmission should be an intentional and well-planned activity. Effective preparation for the religious mission\nincludes:\n\uf06c Preparing equipment and supplies and protecting the UMT or chaplain section.\n\uf06c Improving situational understanding in order to rehearse and refine the concept of religious support.\n\uf06c Integrating, organizing and configuring religious support assets.\n\uf06c Ensuring religious support assets and resources are ready and positioned.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 3-3",

            "Chapter 4\nExecute and Assess\nEXECUTION ACTIVITIES\n4-1. Execution is putting a plan into action by applying combat power to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0).\nThe focus of planning and preparation activities is mission execution. Execution puts a plan into action by\napplying combat power to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. Execution focuses on actions necessary for\nmission success.\n4-2. Execution activities put the concept of religious support into action in order to support the Soldier\nexecuting the unit mission. Executing the concept of religious support does not simply happen. It occurs\nbecause the chaplain section or UMT conducted effective planning and preparation activities enabling them to\nexecute their concept of support and make adjustments when required due to the fluid and changing conditions\nin the operational environment.\nEXECUTING RELIGIOUS SUPPORT IN DECISIVE ACTION\n4-3. Decisive action is the continuous, simultaneous combination of offensive, defensive, and stability or\nDSCA tasks. Units must be prepared to conduct any combination of these primary tasks either independently or\nas part of a larger force. Planning and preparation activities also include any changes to the plan that facilitates\nthe execution of a transition between the tasks (offense, defense, stability or DSCA.) A transition occurs when\nthe commander makes the assessment that the unit must change its focus from one element of decisive action to\nanother. For example, the commander halts the offense when unit actions result in complete victory and the end\nof hostilities, reach a culminating point, or the commander receives a change in mission from a higher\ncommander. The commander then transitions to the defense or stability. This transition from offense to defense\nor stability would require a change in the unit\u2019s plan and necessitate a change in the concept of religious support\n4-4. Uncertainty exists in all operations; therefore, every decision made during planning, preparation and\nexecution activities come with some level of risk. Risk assessment and mitigation must be part of the planning\nand preparation process.\nSUSTAINING OFFENSIVE TASKS\n4-5. An offensive task is a task conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain, resources, and\npopulation centers (ADRP 3-0). They impose the commander\u2019s will on the enemy. While strategic, operational,\nor tactical considerations may require defending for a time, defeating the enemy requires shifting to the offense.\nThe four primary tasks are:\n\uf06c Movement to contact.\n\uf06c Attack.\n\uf06c Exploitation.\n\uf06c Pursuit.\nFor more information, see ADP 3-90.\n4-6. Religious support is critical during the offense. The chaplain section or UMT must prioritize its efforts\nduring planning and preparation activities accordingly. Counseling and worship opportunities can help reduce\ncombat and operational stress, increase unit cohesion, and enhance Soldier performance. However, the nature of\nthe offense requires careful planning. The constant movement of forces and the operational tempo may limit\naccess to large number of Soldiers at various times during the mission. Chaplains and chaplain assistants must\nplan and prepare for the rapid movement of forces over large areas. Planning and preparation must identify best\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 4-1",
            "Chapter 4\ntimes and locations for delivering religious support prior to conducting the offense and the location of the UMT\nand chaplain section throughout the operation.\n4-7. The offense places great demands on chaplains and chaplain assistants. The sustainment of Soldiers in\nthe offense is high in intensity. The chaplain section or UMT must monitor the tactical situation to maintain\nsituational understanding in order to be prepared for any increase in religious support requirements and\ndemands for religious support. During the offense, the mission to deliver religious support is the same, but the\nreligious support requirements may vary from mission to mission and unit to unit. UMTs and chaplain sections\ndevelop priorities of religious support based on a number of variables that can include task organization\nchanges, main and supporting efforts, time available, casualty rates, and changes in the operational\nenvironment. These variables may change based on the type of unit or echelon of command. For example, the\nUMT in a maneuver battalion may execute a concept of religious support on a different scale and at different\ntimes from those in a theater sustainment battalion. The concept of religious support of a battalion UMT is\ndifferent from a division chaplain section.\n4-8. Higher casualty rates associated with offensive tasks may increase the requirement for additional\nreligious support. All UMTs and chaplain sections must consider alternative methods for delivering religious\nsupport in emergencies. The primary focus for chaplains and chaplain assistants involves nurturing the living\nand caring for the wounded and dying. Some situations may allow for honoring the dead. Planning and\ncoordination for worship services, sacraments and ordinances, individual counseling, and visitation is essential\nand important for Soldiers. However, the unit mission, the operational environment and the mission variables\ninfluence the execution of the religious support mission. Thorough planning, rehearsals, and the ability to adapt\nin the area of operations enable the chaplain and chaplain assistant to provide comprehensive religious support\ndespite the confusion and chaos of battle.\n4-9. Supervision is critical at each echelon of command. The constant movement of units over time and\nterrain, as well as the tempo of operations affects the supervisory requirements of the delivery by subordinate\nUMTs. Supervisory UMTs and chaplain sections supervise subordinates, clarify subordinate understanding of\nthe mission, answer requests for information, anticipate potential religious support requirements, plan and\nprepare for the required resources and then develop a priority of religious support.\n4-10. As the unit consolidates and reorganizes after battle, the chaplain section or UMT assesses the mission\nvariables to determine subsequent actions for religious support planning, preparation and execution. For\nexample, if the unit is planning a transition to defensive or stability tasks, the chaplain and chaplain assistant\nplans and prepares for the next unit mission.\nSUSTAINING DEFENSIVE TASKS\n4-11. A defensive task is conducted to defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economize forces, and develop\nfavorable conditions for offensive or stability operations (ADRP 3-0). Military forces generally defend only\nuntil they gain sufficient strength to execute a counteroffensive or a counterattack. Though the outcome of\ndecisive combat derives from the offense, it is often necessary, even advisable, to defend. The three defensive\ntasks are area defense, mobile defense and retrograde (delay, withdrawal and retirement). The defense typically\nrequires more centralized control. Movement of materiel and troops within the area of operations will be closely\nand continuously coordinated, controlled and monitored (ADRP 4-0). Throughout the defense, units are\npreparing fighting positions for the coming enemy attack, conducting counter-reconnaissance missions, or\nexecuting sustainment operations. See ADP 3-90 for more information.\n4-12. In the defense, the chaplain section or UMT may have more time to synchronize its concept of religious\nsupport and apply maximum religious support assets to critical areas. Proper analysis and planning enhance the\nsynchronization of the delivery of religious support during the different phases and increase the effectiveness of\nthe concept of religious support. Chaplains and chaplain assistants must be prepared to adapt to the changing\ntactical situation. For example, in a mobile defense, the commander combines offensive, defensive, and\nretrograde actions and this will require flexibility in the concept of religious support.\n4-13. Like in the offense, the primary focus for religious support execution is nurturing the living, caring for the\nwounded and dying with a possibility of time for honoring the dead. While access to Soldiers may be easier,\nenemy artillery, reconnaissance operations, and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats will\nrequire significant planning and preparation activities (ability to travel or gather Soldiers for worship or other\n4-2 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",
            "Execute and Assess\nreligious support activities, primary and alternate protection positions, communication plan and required\nequipment).\n4-14. The chaplain and chaplain assistant consider the following when planning religious support in the\ndefense:\n\uf06c Degree of engagement with enemy forces by friendly forces\n\uf06c Threats (artillery, enemy aviation, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear)\n\uf06c Level of exposure and risk to Soldiers and equipment when gathered for worship and other activities\n\uf06c Priorities for religious support based on time, space and unit mission\n\uf06c Anticipated operations in response to enemy attack and UMT or chaplain section actions\n\uf06c Other available religious support assets (other UMTs, distinctive faith group leaders, multinational\nchaplains)\n4-15. As the unit consolidates and reorganizes after battle, the chaplain section or UMT assesses the mission\nvariables to determine subsequent actions for religious support planning, preparation and execution. For\nexample, if the unit is planning a transition to offensive or stability tasks, the chaplain and chaplain assistant\nplans and prepares for the next phase.\nSUSTAINING STABILITY TASKS\n4-16. Stability is an overarching term encompassing various military missions, tasks, and activities conducted\noutside the United States, in coordination with other instruments of national power, to maintain or reestablish a\nsafe and secure environment; and provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure\nreconstruction, and humanitarian relief (JP 3-0). Stability operations can help establish political, legal, social,\nand economic institutions, and support the transition to legitimate local governance. The primary tasks are:\n\uf06c Civil security\n\uf06c Civil control\n\uf06c Restore essential services\n\uf06c Support to governance and support to economic and infrastructure development\nFor more information, see ADP 3-07.\n4-17. The chaplain section or UMT always places a priority on first performing and providing religious support\nto Soldiers and command-authorized civilians. Depending on the mission of the unit and the type of unit they\nserve, chaplains and chaplain assistants must be prepared to support the commander\u2019s increased needs for\nadvisement regarding host-nation religion and religious issues including places of religious worship, religious\neducation, and cultural sites. The commander may leverage the chaplain to conduct a Soldier and Leader\nEngagement as a means to support the stability operation. See ATP 1-05.03 for more information on Soldier\nand leader engagements.\n4-18. Chaplain sections or UMTs provide support to planning and operations with cultural awareness\ninformation \u2013 specifically information on religion and religious issues within the area of operations. Upon\ndirection of the commander, and as part of the religious advisor capability, the chaplain section or UMT may\nplan for integrating into the unit\u2019s broad mission to assist a nation in moving from violent conflict to\nnormalization. Within each of primary tasks are sub-tasks that set the conditions for a successful stabilization of\nthe country. The chaplain may advise the commander on many of these sub-tasks, including:\n\uf06c Establish civil security. Protect key personnel and facilities, including places of religious worship\nand cultural sites.\n\uf06c Establish civil control. Establish public order and safety, including protecting vulnerable population\nelements such as dislocated civilians.\n\uf06c Restore essential services. Support human rights initiatives, including generally preventing further\nabuse of vulnerable populations and providing for their long-term well-being.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 4-3",
            "Chapter 4\nSUSTAINING DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES (DSCA) TASKS\n4-19. Department of Defense support for domestic emergencies is executed through two distinct but interrelated\nmissions \u2013 Homeland Defense and Defense Support of Civil Authorities. DSCA operations involve Department\nof Defense support to U.S. civil authorities for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and\nother activities. The primary tasks are:\n\uf06c Provide support for domestic disasters.\n\uf06c Provide support for domestic chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents.\n\uf06c Support civil law enforcement.\n\uf06c Provide other designated support.\n4-20. Defense support of civil authorities is defined as support provided by United States Federal military\nforces, National Guard forces performing duty in accordance with Title 32, United States Code, Department of\nDefense civilians, contract personnel and component assets, in response to requests for assistance from civil\nauthorities for special events, domestic emergencies, designated law enforcement support, and other domestic\nactivities. (Department of Defense Directive 5111.13) Many types of missions (disasters, national or state\nemergency) could constitute a crisis response. For more information on DSCA, see ADP 3-28.\n4-21. DSCA operations usually are a Title 32 (state) mission until the state requests federal (Title 10, active\nmilitary) support or the extent of the mission results in federalization. This type of operation requires extensive\ncoordination between multi-jurisdictional entities (municipal, county, and state agencies) as well as federal\nagencies and non-governmental agencies. The United States Army Reserve and the Army National Guard often\nhave habitual relationships with such agencies to respond quickly and appropriately in support of such\noperations. This is particularly so when the Joint Task Forces of each state respond to provide consequence\nmanagement to catastrophes such as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents.\n4-22. DSCA operations require the chaplain section or UMT to know the restrictions, limitations, and proper\nresponsibilities of the chaplain and chaplain assistant in providing religious support under both civilian law and\nmilitary authority. See ADRP 3-28, DSCA for a discussion on tactics, techniques, and procedures for DSCA\noperations and JP 1-05, Religious Affairs in Joint Operations.\n4-23. Unit ministry teams perform or provide religious support to military units; perform liaison\nresponsibilities with state and federal agencies, pertaining to religious issues; and when directed by the\ncommander, engage with civilian-religious leaders. This is particularly critical when responding to catastrophes,\nwhether man-made (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents) or naturally-occurring (hurricane,\nearthquake or tornado).\n4-24. Religious support within DSCA operations depends heavily on jurisdictional coordination. When\ndirected by the commander, the chaplain section or UMT conducts multi-component (active, Reserve National\nGuard), intra-agency, and inter-governmental organization coordination to effectively perform and provide\nreligious support. Coordination must occur at the highest level possible. The active and reserve chaplains and\nchaplain assistants will integrate and execute a concept of religious support that provides seamless religious\nsupport. This involves extensive coordination and liaison among the active, Guard and Reserve components.\nASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES\n4-25. Assessment is the determination of the progress towards accomplishing a task, creating an effect, or\nachieving an objective (JP 3-0). Assessing is continuous and influences the other three activities in the\noperations process (plan, prepare and execute). It precedes and guides every operations process activity and\nconcludes each operation or phase of an operation. For more information on assessment, see ADRP 5-0 and\nATTP 5-0.1 for more information.\n4-26. The assessment process is the responsibility of all staff sections. Successful execution of an operation\nrequires an understanding of the situation to assess its progress and making adjustments if necessary.\nAssessment is critical to the successful execution of the religious support mission. UMTs or chaplain sections\nmaintain running estimates of religious support capabilities, religious factors analysis and readiness. They\ncompare forecasted outcomes (task to move a Catholic priest every seven days) with actual events (weather or\nenemy activity impacted movement of priest to every 14 days) to determine the overall effectiveness of the\n4-4 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",
            "Execute and Assess\nconcept of religious support. The primary tools a UMT or chaplain section can use to assess progress include\nthe operations order, the common operational picture, personal observations, input from subordinates and other\nstaff sections and working groups, running estimates, and the unit assessment plan.\n4-27. Chaplains and chaplain assistants assess religion and religious support requirements in the operational\nenvironment by monitoring the current situation to collect relevant information and evaluating progress toward\nattaining end state conditions, achieving objectives, and performing tasks. Continual assessment allows the\nUMT or chaplain section to learn and adapt as new information becomes available that provides a clearer\npicture of religious support requirements or changes in the operational environment.\n\uf06c Monitoring. Monitoring is continuous observation of those conditions relevant to the current\noperations (ADRP 5-0). The running estimate is a tool to assess the current operational situation and\nthe concept of religious support and evaluate progress toward the desired endstate. UMTs and\nchaplain sections use new information and updated facts and assumptions as the basis for evaluation.\n\uf06c Evaluating. Evaluating is using criteria to judge progress toward desired conditions and determining\nwhy the current degree of progress exists (ADRP 5-0). UMTs and chaplain sections analyze relevant\ninformation collected through monitoring to evaluate the progress of the execution of the religious\nsupport mission. Evaluation helps chaplain sections and UMTs determine progress toward mission\naccomplishment (what is working and not working in the plan, prepare and execute activities), gain\ninsights into better accomplishing the religious support mission and make required changes or\nrecommendations to the commander.\n4-28. During planning activities, UMTs and chaplain sections analyze the unit mission and the operational\nenvironment in order to understand the current conditions (religious factors, religious support requirements,\naccommodation issues, supervision) and develop an assessment plan (what and how to assess). This enables the\nUMT or chaplain section to develop facts and assumptions that support the development of the concept of\nreligious support.\n4-29. Throughout preparation activities, assessment focuses on determining personnel, equipment and\nsustainment readiness that supports mission execution. The assessment plan enables UMTs and chaplain\nsections to verify assumptions that impact the execution of the concept of religious support.\n4-30. While executing the concept of religious support, assessment evaluates the concept of religious support\nto determine if it supports the unit mission and sustains Soldiers. UMTs and chaplain sections monitor the\nsituation to determine if the facts are still relevant, if their assumptions remain valid, and if new conditions\nemerged that affect the execution of religious support. While assessment may identify problems, unless it\nresults in recommended adjustments to the concept of religious support, its use to a chaplain section or UMT or\na commander is limited. Execution decisions are based on anticipated decision points. Adjustment decisions are\nbased on variances from the anticipated execution path. See ADRP 5-0, paragraphs 4-22 to 4-33 for more\ninformation on execution decisions and adjustment decisions.\n4-31. Assessment during the execution stage makes it possible to adapt and continuously refine the operation\nas the situation changes. As part of the operations process, chaplains and chaplain assistants learn from the\nexecution of their plan and modify or develop a new concept of religious support which is then executed\nthrough a fragmentary order. A fragmentary order is the normal means of controlling execution when changes\nin the base plan or order are required.\nSUMMARY\n4-32. The impact of deployments, close combat and religion in the operational environment cumulatively\nincrease the religious, psychological, and interpersonal demands on Soldiers and Families. Chaplains and\nchaplain assistants seek to use all available resources effectively to sustain Soldiers and Families. Planning and\npreparation activities must leverage time, transportation, available resources, and technology to support the\nsuccessful execution of the concept of religious support.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 4-5",

            "Appendix A\nReligious Support Planning and the Running Estimate\nA-1. Planning, preparation, execution and assessment activities require an accurate and up to date running\nestimate. A running estimate is the continuous assessment of the current situation used to determine if the current\noperation is proceeding according to the commander\u2019s intent and if future operations are supportable (ADP 5-0).\nEach staff section maintains a running estimate focused on how their specific areas of expertise are postured to\nsupport future operations. See ATTP 5-0.1 for more information.\nA-2. UMTs and chaplain sections assist commanders by providing religious support and advising on religion\n(internal and external) through the operations process. UMTs and chaplain sections at all echelons use the running\nestimate to assess their section\u2019s ability to support the commander\u2019s mission. UMTs and chaplain sections\nimmediately begin updating their running estimates upon receipt of mission. As a key product in religious support\nplanning, the running estimate must answer the commander\u2019s \u201cso what\u201d question. During planning, running\nestimates are key sources of information during mission analysis. As they transition, they use running estimates\nto identify the current readiness of the unit in relationship to its mission. The commander and staff also use running\nestimates to develop, then track, mission readiness goals and additional requirements. During execution, UMTs and\nchaplain sections incorporate information included in running estimates into the common operational picture. This\nenables them to depict key information from each functional area or warfighting function as it impacts current and\nfuture operations. This information directly supports the commander\u2019s visualization and rapid decisionmaking\nduring operations\nA-3. UMTs and chaplain sections continuously analyze new information during operations to assess if operations\nare progressing according to plan. UMTs and chaplain sections use their running estimates to develop measures of\neffectiveness and measures of performance to support their analysis. The assessment of current operations also\nsupports validation or rejection of additional information that will help update the estimates and support further\nplanning. The following format provides guidelines for integrating religious support input by UMTs and chaplain\nsections while developing and maintaining a running estimate (see figure A-1).\nFigure A-1.

See\nATTP 5-0.1 for more information.\nUMTs and chaplain sections may not have input or participation in all 19 tasks. However, integration into this step\nof the process is critical. Mission analysis enables UMTs and chaplain sections to gain a situational understanding of\nthe operational environment, determine the religious support requirements that support the unit mission and set the\nconditions for the planning, preparation and execution activities. General guidance questions include:\n\uf06c What is the unit mission? How will we support the mission?\n\uf06c Who can provide support? Who else can provide support?\n\uf06c What do we know?

See ATP 1-05.03: External Advisement on advising on religion\nand the operational environment.\nDetermine specified and implied tasks. The staff analyzes the higher headquarters order and commander\u2019s\nguidance to determine specified and implied tasks. These are found in the base order or in the annexes. Specified\ntasks are those assigned to a subordinate unit by a higher headquarters. (\u201cConduct worship services for all company-\nsized elements in the unit area in accordance with commander\u2019s guidance and intent every X days\u201d). Implied tasks\nare those that must be performed to accomplish a specified task or mission but are not stated in the higher\nheadquarters order. (In order to conduct worship services for all company-sized elements in the unit area, the UMT\nmust coordinate with the appropriate staff elements for transportation support (air or ground) to meet higher\nheadquarters commander\u2019s guidance every X days).\nReview available assets and identify resource shortfalls (assets to task). The commander and staff examine\nadditions to and deletions from the current task organization. Mission analysis identifies all units requiring religious\nsupport and all available religious support assets (personnel, equipment and supplies) and shortfalls (lack of a\nchaplain, chaplain assistant or faith group requirement) in order to determine if they have the assets or need to\nrequest additional assets to accomplish the religious support mission. Supervisory chaplains and chaplain assistants\ndevelop plans for additional religious support requirements (casualty care, personnel replacement or faith group\nrequirements). This enables a UMT or chaplain section to determine the Chaplain Corps required capabilities and\ncore competencies requirements by phase, to include:\n\uf06c Religious support requirements for pre-deployment, rear detachment operations, deployment,\nreception, staging and onward movement and integration and offensive, defensive, stability and\nDSCA tasks and redeployment.\n\uf06c Transitions and the religious support requirements for each transition. A transition occurs when the\ncommander makes an assessment that the unit must change its focus from one element of decisive\naction (offense, defense, stability or defense support of civil authorities) to another. Each transition\nhas a specific religious support requirement that requires detailed planning.\n\uf06c Relief in Place and Transfer of authority operations (transfer of supervision over religious support\nassets, coverage of units, chapel facilities and religious property) and impact on religious support\nplanning, preparation and execution.\n\uf06c Branches, sequels or contingencies that may require an adjustment to the concept of religious\nsupport.\nDetermine constraints. Mission analysis of the order or plan identifies constraints that impact the execution of\nreligious support. A constraint is a restriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an\naction or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. It can be a requirement to do\nsomething (bypass criteria, size of reserve force) or a prohibition on actions (no movement before a certain time,\nprohibited routes). An example of a religious support constraint from higher headquarters could be \u201call UMTs will\nmove by air throughout the theater.\u201d\nAt the conclusion of the mission analysis step, UMTs and chaplain sections update the running estimate with new\ninformation, updated facts and assumptions or additional tasks.\nB-4. Step 3: Course of Action Development. A course of action is a broad potential solution to an identified\nproblem. Mission analysis provides information needed to develop courses of action. This step aims to determine\none or more ways to accomplish the unit mission. This step generates options for follow-on analysis and comparison\nthat satisfy the commander's intent and planning guidance. Planners develop the approved course of action into a\nconcept of operations. General guidance questions include:\n\uf06c What needs to happen?\n\uf06c How do we get there (religious support mission end state) from here? (current situation)\nUsing the time available, UMT and chaplain sections generate options (comprehensive and flexible religious support\ncourses of action) for executing Soldier religious support and unit mission requirements for each unit course of\naction. The religious support courses of action will become the foundation for the future development of the concept\nof religious support. Religious support courses of action by higher headquarters UMTs and chaplain sections should\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 B-5",

A\ncourse of action should address:\n\uf06c Provide requirements (worship, counseling, casualty, memorials) by phase or task\n\uf06c Advise requirements (ethical implications of unit courses of action, indigenous religions, holy days,\nreligious requirements of Soldiers) by phase or task\n\uf06c Sustainment requirements for mission success (transportation, religious support personnel, supplies)\n\uf06c Planning, preparation and coordination requirements to include equipment (eye protection, chemical,\nbiological, radiological and nuclear protective mask, maps), unit movement schedule, theater medical\nplan, changes in task organization, change in phase, location by phase\n\uf06c Religious Support troop to task analysis (compare religious support resources to specified and\nimplied tasks) to determine effective religious support force employment\nDuring this step, UMTs and chaplain sections work closely with other staff elements to insure that its concept of\nreligious support is itself supportable in terms of resourcing (supply, funds, facilities, personnel), movement of\npersonnel, and security. Planning that affects other units or which redirects subordinate chaplains and chaplain\nassistants to tasks outside their normal unit responsibilities should be staffed with those units before finalizing the\nunit plan.\nB-5. Step 4: Course of action Analysis and War-gaming. This step enables commanders and staffs to identify\ndifficulties or coordination problems as well as probable consequences of planned actions for each course of action\nbeing considered. This step helps them think through the tentative plan. Analysis uncovers potential execution\nproblems, decisions, and contingencies. Analysis influences how a commander and staff understand a problem and\nmay require the planning process to restart. During the war game, the staff takes each course of action and begins to\ndevelop a detailed plan while determining its strengths or weaknesses. War-gaming tests and improves the courses\nof action. The commander and staff consider how to create conditions for success, protect the force, and shape the\noperational environment. General guidance questions include:\n\uf06c What are the second and third order effects?\n\uf06c How do we synchronize our efforts (unit, higher, staff)?\nAnalysis for UMTs and chaplain sections addresses:\n\uf06c Problems which will impact the execution of any religious support requirements or any religious\nfactors (physical, human and ideological) which will impact unit mission execution\n\uf06c Changes to the task organization, unit mission or phase of the operation and the impact on the\nconcept of religious support.\n\uf06c Required religious support and sustainment resources, and where, when and how frequently they will\nbe needed in order to develop priorities of religious support\n\uf06c Any additional planning and preparation requirements that impact the execution phase\nB-6. Step 5: Course of action Comparison. Comparison of the courses of action is critical. This step is an\nobjective process used to evaluate each course of action independently and against set evaluation criteria approved\nby the commander and staff. The goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each course of action and enable\nselecting a course of action with the highest probability of success, and further developing it in a plan or order. After\ncompleting its analysis and comparison, the staff identifies its preferred course of action and makes a\nrecommendation. General guidance questions include:\n\uf06c What are the advantages and disadvantages of each religious support course of action?\n\uf06c What are the potential decision points?\n\uf06c What are the religious support requirements for each course of action?\nB-6 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",

Step 6: Course of action Approval. After the decision briefing, the commander selects the course of\naction that best accomplishes the mission. If the commander rejects all courses of action, the staff starts the\ndevelopment step again. If the commander modifies a proposed course of action or gives the staff an entirely\ndifferent one, the staff war games the new course of action and presents the results to the commander with a\nrecommendation. After selecting a course of action, the commander issues the final planning guidance. Based on the\ncommander\u2019s decision and final planning guidance, the staff issues a warning order to subordinate headquarters.\nThis order contains the information subordinate units need to refine their plans. Once a unit course of action is\napproved, the supporting religious support course of action will be developed into the concept of religious support\nby the UMT or chaplain section.\nGeneral guidance questions include:\n\uf06c What required changes to the running estimate?\n\uf06c Who else needs to know?\n\uf06c How will I develop this into a concept of religious support?\nB-8. Step 7: Orders Production, Dissemination and Transition. The staff prepares the order or plan by\nturning the selected course of action into a clear, concise concept of operations and the required supporting\ninformation. Army organizations use three types of orders: Operation order (OPORD), Fragmentary order\n(FRAGORD), Warning order (WARNORD). A UMT or chaplain section develops and publishes the concept of\nreligious support as an attachment: Tab D (Religious Support) to Appendix 2 (Personnel Services Support) to Annex\nF (Sustainment). This step bridges the transition between planning activities and preparation activities.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 B-7",

Phasing is a way to view and conduct a complex operation in manageable parts and can be indicated by\ntime, distance, terrain, or event. A phase is a planning and execution tool used to divide an operation in duration and\nactivity (ADRP 3-0). An operational phase is characterized by the \u201cfocus\u201d that is placed on it. (See Figure C-1.) A\nchange in phase (transition) usually involves a combination of changes of mission, task organization, priorities of\nsupport, or rules of engagement. For more information on operational phases, see JP 3-0, JP 5-0 and ADRP 5-0.\nFigure C-1. Notional operational plan phases\nC-2. Religious support planning aligns with the potential phases of an operation. Religious support requirements\nmay overlap multiple phases. Each phase requires chaplains and chaplain assistants to develop a specific concept of\nreligious support in order to execute the Chaplain Corps required capabilities (provide and advise) and core\ncompetencies (nurture, care and honor). In addition, a joint campaign or operation may be conducted in multiple\nphases simultaneously if the area of operations has widely varying conditions and this will impact the planning,\npreparation and execution of the religious support mission at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 C-1",

For UMTs and chaplain sections, activities can include:\n\uf06c Provide and Advise: Chapel worship, on-call duty, memorials, funeral duty, retreats, counseling.\n\uf06c Training: Unit mission training (combat center rotations, gunnery, weapons qualification, regional\nalignment), monthly division or installation training, Soldier tasks, chaplain corps specific training or\nschools (enlisted, officer, counseling skills).\n\uf06c Operational: Combat training center pre-rotation planning, regional alignment planning and\npreparation, developing and updating operational products (standard operating procedures, running\nestimates, battle books, battle drills, religious census, and leader books), equipment and supplies\n(ordering, maintenance, developing load plans), personnel readiness, supervision.\nPhase I: Deter (Action: Crisis Defined)\nC-5. This phase includes activities to prepare forces and set conditions for deployment and employment of\nforces in the event that deterrence is not successful. Once the crisis is defined, these actions may include\nmobilization, tailoring of forces and other predeployment activities and initial deployment into a theater. For UMTs\nand chaplain sections, activities can include:\n\uf06c Provide and Advise: Field and predeployment worship at chapels, unit areas, training areas, railhead,\nand ports; religious education; pastoral counseling; Family deployment briefings.\n\uf06c Training: Unit mission training (convoy, weapons qualification, combat training center, Soldier\ntasks); Area of operations focused training; mission readiness exercise.\n\uf06c Operational: Participate in initial planning and analyze the mission requirements and higher order for\nall religious support requirements; execute pre-deployment religious support tasks (close offices,\nchapels, briefings, standard operating procedures, battle books, religious area assessment); complete\npersonnel, equipment and supply requests; pack and load equipment and supplies for movement into\ntheater; initiate rear detachment concept of religious support; execute movement into theater; execute\nreception, staging, onward movement and integration activities; supervision.\nPhase II: Seize the initiative (Action: Assure friendly freedom of action; Access theater infrastructure)\nC-6. In combat operations, this involves executing offensive operations at the earliest possible time, forcing the\nadversary to offensive culmination, and setting the conditions for decisive operations. Rapid application of joint\ncombat power may be required to delay, impede, or halt the adversary's initial aggression and to deny the initial\nobjectives.

            "Appendix D\nReligious Support Planning and the Deployment Cycle\nDEPLOYMENT\nD-1. Deployment is composed of activities required to prepare and move forces, supplies, and equipment to a\ntheater. This involves the force as it task organizes, tailors itself for movement based on the mission, concept of\noperations, available lift, and other resources. Deployment planning is a logical process that focuses on Soldiers,\nsupplies and equipment, ways to deploy them, and the required information to track them (FM 3-35).\nD-2. UMTs and chaplain sections conduct planning, preparation, execution and assessment activities that enable\nthem to provide religious support throughout the full cycle of the deployment process:\n\uf06c Mobilization: the process by which the Armed Forces or part of them are brought to a state of\nreadiness for war or other national emergency. This includes activating all or part of the Reserve\nComponents as well as assembling and organizing personnel, supplies, and equipment.\n\uf06c Deployment: the activities required to prepare and move forces, supplies, and equipment to a theater\nand the movement of forces to an operational area in response to an order.\n\uf06c Employment: how to apply force or forces to attain specified national strategic objectives.\n\uf06c Sustainment: provision of logistics, personnel services, and health service support necessary to\nmaintain and prolong operations until successful mission accomplishment.\n\uf06c Redeployment: the return of forces to the home or demobilization station.\nThe deployment cycle is divided into three interrelated phases: predeployment activities, movement, and reception,\nstaging, onward movement and integration. Deployment religious support planning activities are critical throughout\nall three phases.\nPREDEPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES\nD-3. During predeployment, units constantly plan for various contingencies and hone their deployment skills.\nUnits validate load and movement plans and ensure personnel readiness (administrative and medical). UMTs and\nchaplain sections train with the unit, ensure equipment, supplies and personnel are ready to deploy, verify the\nreligious census of unit and execute programs that support Soldiers and Families. They work with the installation\nchaplain section to close chapels, hand receipt property, coordinate deployment support and initiate rear detachment\nactivities.\nMOVEMENT\nD-4. Deploying units immediately configure for deployment, reduce or prepare vehicles and aircraft for\nmovement, properly stow and tie down secondary loads, construct pallets, and prepare the required documentation.\nUMTs and chaplain sections prepare and load equipment for deployment, execute resiliency activities for deploying\nSoldiers and Families and prepare themselves to move into theater.\n\uf06c Fort to Port: The Fort to Port phase begins with units preparing and moving personnel and equipment\nfrom the installation to a designated aerial port of embarkation and seaport of embarkation for\ntransport to a theater of operations. Units will conduct rail operations to move equipment and\nsupplies from home station to the seaport of embarkation. The aerial port of embarkation is the\ntransition point for Army units deploying by air. The unit organizes personnel into deployment\npackages and personnel rosters are prepared for each chalk or planeload. Based on theater mission\nrequirements, the unit configures personnel into advance party, main body and trail party for\nmovement by air into theater.\n\uf06c Port to Port: The Port to Port phase begins with strategic lift departures from aerial ports of\nembarkation and sea ports of embarkation and ends with lift assets arriving in the designated theater\naerial port of debarkation and sea ports of debarkation with the equipment and personnel required for\nthe mission.\n12 May 2014 ATP 1-05.01 D-1",

It matches\npersonnel with their equipment, minimizes staging and sustainment requirements while transiting the ports of\ndebarkation and begins onward movement as quickly as possible in order to execute the unit mission. Units need to\nhave a full understanding of this process in order to support effective planning. Planning factors include the\noperational environment, operational tempo, command and control and force protection (FM 3-35). Upon\ncompletion, UMTs and chaplain sections must be prepared to execute the concept of religious support in theater as\nthe unit executes the assigned mission.\n\uf06c Reception: Unloading personnel and equipment from strategic transport assets, managing port\nmarshalling areas, transporting personnel, equipment, and materiel to staging areas, and providing\nlogistics support services to units transiting the aerial and seaports of debarkation. Upon arrival,\nUMTs and chaplain sections secure equipment, provide religious support to Soldiers, and prepare to\nmove.\n\uf06c Staging: This is organizing personnel, equipment, and basic loads into movement units; preparing the\nunits for onward movement to the tactical assembly area and other locations; and providing logistics\nsupport for units transiting the staging area (movement control, repair, medical and protection).\nUMTs and chaplain sections continue to provide religious support until they are organized with their\nunit into convoys for movement.\n\uf06c Onward Movement: Moving units from reception facilities and staging areas to the tactical assembly\nareas or other theater destinations; moving non-unit personnel to gaining commands; and moving\nsustainment supplies to distribution sites. Upon arrival in the tactical assembly area, UMTs and\nchaplain sections prepare equipment and supplies, provide religious support to Soldiers, and prepare\nthemselves to support the unit mission.\n\uf06c Integration: It is the synchronized transfer of capabilities into an operational commander\u2019s force prior\nto mission execution. Units assume their role within the higher headquarters force.\nREDEPLOYMENT\nD-6. Redeployment involves the return of personnel, equipment, and materiel from the theater back to home or\ndemobilization stations and requires detailed planning, preparation and execution activities. The phases of\nredeployment are redeployment planning, pre-redeployment activities, movement, and reception and integration at\nthe home or demobilization station. Upon completion of movement back to home station or demobilization station,\nUMTs and chaplain sections must be prepared to execute a concept of religious support that sustains Soldiers and\nFamilies (FM 3-35).\nD-2 ATP 1-05.01 12 May 2014",

            "Introduction\nATP 1-05.02 establishes a common understanding, foundational concepts, and methods\nfor executing religious support during funeral services and memorial events.\nATP 1-05.02 provides comprehensive doctrinal guidance on religious support\ntechniques for chaplains and religious affairs specialists. The techniques contained in\nATP 1-05.02 serve as a guide and are not considered prescriptive. ATP 1-05.02 nests\nwith FM 1-05.\nATP 1-05.02 was written for chaplain sections and unit ministry teams at all echelons\nreligious support in an operational environment. While written for an operational\nenvironment, the concepts and principles are also applicable in a garrison setting. It also\nprovides the chaplain corps technical chain with guidance to execute supervisory\nrequirements during the funeral or memorial process. Chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists serving in a joint force land component command or a joint task force should\nrefer to JP 3-0, JG 1-05, and other joint planning publications for further guidance.\nATP 1-05.02 contains three chapters and two appendixes:\n(cid:122) Chapter 1 reviews the chaplain corps mission, chaplain corps capabilities,\nreligious support core competencies, and religious support to funerals and\nmemorial events.\n(cid:122) Chapter 2 describes funerals, including arrangements, care to the bereaved,\nmilitary funeral considerations, chapel funerals, graveside services, and\npresentation of the flag.\n(cid:122) Chapter 3 describes the differences between memorial ceremonies,\nmemorial services, combatant theater memorial events, and ramp\nceremonies, and concludes with a discussion of planning considerations and\nactivities.\n(cid:122) Appendix A provides templates covering planning timelines, sample script\noutlines, the last roll call, and questions to support checklist development.\nSeveral resources are provided which support the conduct of funerals,\nmemorial ceremonies, and memorial services.\n(cid:122) Appendix B provides a discussion of special planning considerations which\nare distinct to the conduct of memorial events.\n(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27) ATP 1-05.02 v",

            "Chapter 1\nReligious Support\nMISSION\n1-1. The mission of the Army Chaplain Corps is to provide religious support (RS) to\nthe Army across the range of military operations by assisting commanders in providing\nfor the free exercise of religion and providing religious, moral, and ethical advisement\nand leadership. (See figure 1-1.)\nFigure 1-1. Religious support logic map\n(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27) ATP 1-05.02 1-1",
            "Chapter 1\nREQUIRED CAPABILITIES\n1-2. The Army requires chaplain sections and unit ministry teams (UMTs) to provide\nRS and advisement to commanders on the impact of religion. These two required\ncapabilities reflect the dual role of the Chaplain Corps, religious leader and professional\nmilitary religious advisor:\n(cid:122) As religious leaders, the Army requires the capability to provide RS across\naustere and isolated locations which accommodates service members\u2019 right\nto the free exercise of religion and supports resiliency efforts to sustain\nservice members in combat. RS tasks sustain the individual service member,\nextending upward throughout the entire command structure and outward to\nthe broadest command audience authorized. RS is comprehensive because\nevery individual personally defines what constitutes RS. While not every\nreligious need of every Soldier can be met, chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists seek to meet as many needs as possible.\n(cid:122) As the professional military religious advisor, the chaplain advises the\ncommander and staff on religion, ethics, morals, and morale, and their impact\non all aspects of military operations.\nRELIGIOUS SUPPORT CORE COMPETENCIES\n1-3. The three core competencies of the Chaplain Corps provide a clear and consistent\nway of conveying expectations of the dual role of chaplains as religious leaders and\nprofessional military religious advisors. These provide focus and direction for the\nChaplain Corps\u2019 execution of its critical RS mission to nurture the living, care for the\nwounded, and honor the dead. (See FM 1-05 for more discussion on RS core\ncompetencies.)\nRELIGIOUS SUPPORT TO FUNERALS AND\nMEMORIAL EVENTS\n1-4. As an integral part of the three core competencies, chaplains provide religious\nsupport during funeral services and memorial events. A memorial event may be\nperformed by a unit following the death of a Soldier in an operational environment (OE).\nA unit may perform a memorial event at home station in a post chapel, the post theater,\nor another appropriate facility. A chaplain may offer a prayer during a ramp ceremony\non an airfield in an OE. A funeral may be rendered at a local cemetery, the post chapel,\nor at a location selected by the Family. A chaplain may conduct a funeral for Soldiers,\nretirees, uniformed members of a joint force, authorized civilians, or Family members.\nThese time-honored traditions are part of the Army profession.\n1-5. The chaplain\u2019s primary role during military funerals and memorial events is to\nensure the religious portion is provided for with sensitivity to the religious and emotional\nneeds of the Family and the military unit of the deceased. The chaplain section or\nUMT encourage a positive tone and attitude in the unit, prepares an appropriate order of\n1-2 ATP 1-05.02 (cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27)",
            "Religious Support\nworship, a message of hope, or an appropriate memorial event to address Family and\nunit needs.\n1-6. The chaplain is a personal staff officer advising commanders in matters pertaining\nto the religious aspects of military funerals and memorial events. Due to the religious\ndiversity of the nation and Army, all chaplains must know the funeral practices and\nreligious requirements of various faith groups in the military. The chaplain advises\ncommanders on matters that pertain to the religious aspects of funerals or memorial\nevents and may be directed by commanders to oversee the coordination of other details.\nAs a special staff officer, the chaplain, working on behalf of the commander, coordinates\nwith other agencies and sections to provide a well-coordinated event. As religious\nleaders, chaplains play an important role in the Army\u2019s tribute to Soldiers and those\nauthorized civilians who have honorably served their nation.\n1-7. The religious affairs specialist coordinates support for the chaplain throughout the\nentire process of advising, planning, and providing an event. (In the absence of a\nreligious affairs specialist, the chaplain will coordinate these duties and responsibilities.)\nWith the chaplain\u2019s guidance, the religious affairs specialist\u2014\n(cid:122) Consults relevant standard operating procedures (SOPs) and current\nregulations to coordinate and complete the necessary administrative support\nand tasks.\n(cid:122) Ensures the chapel or similar site is properly set-up in accordance with local\nSOPs, regulations, the chaplain performing the service, and any\ndenominational or faith-specific requirements.\n(cid:122) Plans and coordinates security considerations for the chaplain in an OE.\n(cid:122) Serves as a liaison between the command; the chapel, church staff, or\nmemorial site personnel; and if applicable, the burial detail and keeps\nappropriate leaders informed regarding any \u201clast minute\u201d adjustments.\nSUMMARY\n1-8. Chaplain sections and UMTs provide pastoral care to Family and friends, execute\nfunerals and memorial events, and coordinate the support required to properly execute\nthis type of religious support mission. Wherever they are conducted, and regardless of\nthe tasks or order of events, military funerals and memorial events pay tribute to those\nwho have honorably served the nation. Each final tribute draws from national, military,\nand religious traditions, not routinely nor impersonally, but profoundly and with\ncompassion.\n(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27) ATP 1-05.02 1-3",

            "Chapter 2\nMilitary Funerals\nOVERVIEW\n2-1. Religious support facilitates honoring the deceased.Chaplain sections and UMTs\nrevere those who have died, lay to rest those who have served the nation with dignity\nand honor, and treat their Families with respect and compassion. Funerals reflect the\nemphasis the American people place on the worth and value of the individual. Chaplain\nsections and UMTs conduct funerals in accordance with TC 3-21.5. Supervisors train\nsubordinates on the proper roles and responsibilities of the chaplain and religious affairs\nspecialist during a military funeral. It is Department of the Army (DA) policy to provide\nMilitary Funeral Honors (See AR600-25) for all present and former military personnel\nusing the following guidelines\u2014\n(cid:122) Medal of Honor recipients, active duty Soldiers, and retirees are provided full\nMilitary Funeral Honors with a service detail consisting of a 9-member team.\n(cid:122) Veterans are entitled to Military Funeral Honors with a service detail\nconsisting of at least 2 uniformed military members, at least 1 of whom will\nbe from the parent service of the veteran.\n(cid:122) Every effort will be made to obtain a live bugler to play \u201cTaps.\u201d\n(cid:122) Local commanders determine the availability of their resources as they\npertain to Military Funeral Honors support, the composition of the burial\nhonors details, and any restrictions relating to military honors.\n2-2. Military funerals are divided into two classes: chapel service, followed by\nmovement to the grave or place of local disposition with the prescribed escort, and\ngraveside service only. (For further information on burial honors and the composition\nof funeral escorts, see AR600-25.) The word \u201cchapel\u201d is interpreted to include church,\nhome, or other place where services are held, other than the service at the grave. (See\nTC 3-21.5 for more information on military funerals.)\n2-3. There are three types of military funerals that may be performed. They include\u2014\n(cid:122) A full military funeral that normally consists of, or is supported by, a 9-person\nfuneral detail, with the following elements:\nCasualty assistance officer (CAO).\n(cid:132)\nOfficer incharge (OIC) or noncommissioned officer incharge (NCOIC)\n(cid:132)\n(appropriate for the rank of the deceased).\nOne bugler to play \u201cTaps\u201d (or an electronic recording).\n(cid:132)\nSix active duty pallbearers and firing party. (This is a dual function, as\n(cid:132)\nthe pallbearers also serve as the firing party and will render these honors).\nMilitary clergy (if requested and available).\n(cid:132)\n(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27) ATP 1-05.02 2-1",
            "Chapter 2\n(cid:122) If resources permit, a larger funeral detail may be provided, which is\ncomposed of all the elements of the nine-person funeral detail, and may also\ninclude the following:\nColors.\n(cid:132)\nSeparate firing party (no more than 8, or less than 5, riflemen).\n(cid:132)\nHearse (caisson).\n(cid:132)\nHonorary pallbearers.\n(cid:132)\nPersonal colors (if appropriate).\n(cid:132)\nEscort unit or units (appropriate for the rank of the deceased).\n(cid:132)\n(cid:122) A two-man military funeral honors detail consists of the following elements:\nAn OIC or NCOIC (appropriate for the rank of the deceased).\n(cid:132)\nAn enlisted Soldier.\n(cid:132)\n1 bugler to play \u201cTaps\u201d (or an electronic recording).\n(cid:132)\n(See TC 3-21.5 for more information on military funerals.)\nFUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS\n2-4. The casualty assistance center provides burial honors for deceased Army\npersonnel including active duty and retired personnel as well as eligible Reserve\nComponents and authorized veterans when requested by the Family. Chaplain sections\nand UMTs consult local SOPs for notification procedures. Chaplain sections and UMTs\nmust be prepared to call these individuals as soon as possible when notified:\n(cid:122) Supervisory chaplain.\n(cid:122) Chain of command.\n(cid:122) Honor guard NCOIC or OIC.\n(cid:122) Funeral director.\n(cid:122) Immediate Family.\nNote. In most cases chaplain sections and UMTs will have 24-72 hours\u2019 notice\nbefore a funeral.\n2-5. Chaplains are action officers in that they prepare and conduct funeral services.\nReligious affairs specialists help coordinate with CAOs, funeral directors, chapel or\nchurch staffs and other applicable agencies,and they provide support as directed by the\nchaplain and local SOPs.\n2-6. Chaplains may conduct services for both active and retired, and eligible members\nof their Families, at the request of survivors. If a graveside funeral is conducted, the\nFamily may provide input regarding honors provided. The desires of the Family are\ngiven the fullest consideration. Funerals conducted following the death of a Soldier or\nFamily member from a unit are usually conducted by the assigned chaplain. At other\ntimes, a chaplain may be assigned to funeral duty through a tasking from installation or\nhigher headquarters in accordance with a DA Form 6 (Duty(cid:3)(cid:53)oster).(cid:3)(See AR 220-45\n2-2 ATP 1-05.02 (cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27)",
            "Military Funerals\n(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)more information on duty rosters.) Depending on the needs of the Family, funerals\nmay be conducted locally and the chaplain and honor guard may have to travel to a\ndistant location to perform this mission. In either case, the chaplain will be trained and\nready to perform this duty with care and pastoral compassion. For planning purposes,\nchaplain sections and UMTs consider the following guidelines when planning a funeral\nservice and when talking with the Family\u2014\n(cid:122) When possible, a chaplain of the same faith tradition of the deceased will\nconduct the funeral.\n(cid:122) When possible, the chaplain will perform a funeral service which balances\nthe traditions of the officiating chaplain or clergy with the desires of the\nFamily without compromising the chaplain\u2019s endorsing agency\u2019s\nexpectations.\n2-7. Upon notification, chaplains and religious affairs specialists need to quickly\nidentify some basic information from the casualty assistance center, funeral director, and\nFamily that may impact planning and execution of a funeral service. This information\nincludes\u2014\n(cid:122) Who will officiate, a chaplain or civilian clergy?\n(cid:122) What are the Family\u2019s desires? Did they request scripture, poem, hymn, or\nfaith-specific requirements?\n(cid:122) Where will the funeral be held? Will it be at a funeral home, chapel, church,\nsynagogue,mosque, or graveside?\n(cid:122) When will the funeral occur (date and time)?\n2-8. As part of the planning process, chaplains serve as advisors to Families on\nappropriate options honoring their departed loved one, including serving as a decision\nmaker should a Family desire something inappropriate. It is critical that the chaplain\ncontact the Family before the funeral service, either by visiting at the funeral home, or,\nat the very least, contacting them by telephone. The primary responsibility for funeral\narrangements rests with the Family. The Family (or its representative) determines who\nconducts the service and the extent of the military chaplain\u2019s participation. The Family\ndecides where the body is to be buried and whether a chaplain or a civilian clergy person\nwill conduct the service. The Family of the deceased (or its representative) may request\nanother clergy to officiate in lieu of a military chaplain. A civilian clergy person can\nconduct all religious elements of a military funeral or interment. (For further\ninformation, see TC 3-21.5 and AR600-25.)\n2-9. Chaplains should make every effort to comply with Family desires, as regulation\nand protocol permit. At no time will chaplains not need to perform services that are at\nvariance with the tenets of their faith. If the Family opts to have a service without\nmilitary honors, a chaplain may not be required.\n2-10. Although chaplains will not need to perform services that are at variance with the\ntenets of their religion, they may still function as an escort to civilian clergy during a\ngraveside with military honors. Chaplains may be called on to assist or advise civilian\nclergy and Family members with the ceremonial movement aspects of a military funeral.\nThe chaplain briefs other officiants on the military aspects of the funeral and escorts the\n(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27) ATP 1-05.02 2-3",

As with any mission, a well-executed rehearsal by all participants (including the\nchaplain and honor guard) is required to finalize the concept of operations and render\nthe highest quality funeral and graveside service. If possible, the primary participants\nwill meet at least once 24 hours before the event to coordinate the honors and sequence\nof events outlined by the chaplain and OIC or NCOIC.\n2-12. During the funeral, one member of the family will be presented with the U.S. flag.\nIn some cases, families may be divided over who should be entitled to receive the flag.\nThe chaplain must understand the situation, compassionately listen, and be supportive.\n(For more detail, see DODI 1300.18 for a full definition of next of kin).\nCARE TO THE BEREAVED\n2-13. Chaplains hold two roles as clergy and special staff officers when honoring the\ndead. As clergy, they are responsible for the religious service. As special staff officers,\nthey provide the final tribute to deceased service members and represent the command\nto which they are assigned. The chaplain serves as pastor, counselor, and friend to the\nFamily and friends of the deceased.\n2-14. Pastoral care may be given before and after the funeral service through chaplain\nvisits to the Family. The chaplain can provide a supportive spirit to the bereaved by\nproviding hope for the future in the face of death. It is important for the chaplain to\nremember that for some religious traditions, religious rites and sacraments are important\nin spiritual healing.\nMILITARY FUNERAL\n2-15. A full military funeral applies to all military funerals, with distinctions being made\naccording to the rank of the deceased. (For more detail on funeral rank distinctions, see\nAR600-25.)\n2-16. When the funeral is held in a military chapel, the chaplain will consult local SOPs\nfor guidance in arranging the funeral. A chapel funeral service or Mass may last between\n20-30 minutes. Timing may be critical when coordinating with the honors team waiting\nat the graveside or if the chapel is needed for another funeral. The funeral chapel service\nis followed by the movement to the grave or place of interment.\n2-17. For a graveside service, the funeral procession will form at the entrance or at a\npoint within a reasonable distance from the cemetery. The chaplain may travel with the\nFamily to the cemetery. Usually the chaplain will ride with the funeral director, march\nin front of the caisson (for a short distance) or be pre-positioned at the graveside. The\nchaplain stands next to the OIC or NCOIC at the curb, near the grave site, and salutes as\nthe hearse passes. If the chaplain\u2019s first personal contact with the Family occurs at the\ncemetery, the chaplain will go to the Family car to meet them and then return to the\noriginal position at the curb. Then the graveside service is conducted.\n2-4 ATP 1-05.02 (cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27)",
            "Military Funerals\n2-18. When the remains are cremated and the ashes interred with military honors, the\nstandard funeral service is used with necessary modifications. (For more detail on\ncremation, see TC 3-21.5.)\n2-19. When asked to share in a joint worship service with another member of the clergy,\nchaplains are guided by policies set by their denomination or endorsing agent. The\nchaplain participates and is sensitive to the needs of civilian clergy chosen by the\nFamily. When the funeral is conducted at a civilian church, synagogue, or mortuary, the\nchaplain co-officiates at the funeral. In such cases, the chaplain presides when military\nhonors are rendered.\n2-20. The Family or representative of the deceased may request fraternal or patriotic\norganizations, of which the deceased was a member, to take part in the funeral service.\nWith immediate Family approval fraternal or patriotic organizations may conduct\ngraveside service activities at the conclusion of the military portion of the ceremony,\nsignified by the flag presentation to the next of kin and escort departure from the\ncemetery. (See TC 3-21.5 for more information on graveside services.)\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n2-21. Weapons which are not part of the ceremony (in a memorial stand and honors\nfiring team) are generally not carried into a military chapel; excluding OEs. Exceptions\nfor this might include on-duty military and civilian law enforcement personnel. At\noff-post locations and facilities, theOIC, NCOIC, or chaplain will follow the directions\nof the lead representative for the respective location or facility regarding the presence of\nweapons.\n2-22. The chaplain uncovers both inside and outside the chapel if wearing vestments,\nunless aliturgical headdress is worn. The chaplain in uniform uncovers inside the chapel\nand covers outside the chapel (unless standing under a roof or canopy). All personnel\nexcept active pallbearers follow the example of the chaplain in uniform.\n2-23. As part of the overall planning and rehearsal process, if vestments are required,\nchaplains allow time to change quickly because the overall time allotted for the funeral,\ngraveside service, and final honors for the Service member may be limited. Chaplains\nmay consider wearing vestments to the graveside or incorporating the religious affairs\nspecialist into the plan to help them quickly change at an appropriate moment following\nthe funeral service.\n2-24. Planning must also consider weather and any required clothing (including a\njacket, raincoat, hat, or gloves) that must be removed (after entering the chapel) or put\non (during movement to graveside). (For further information on weather and required\nclothing, see TC 3-21.5.) Chaplains ensure that all participants (including the religious\naffairs specialist, OIC, NCOIC, CAO, and funeral director) understand the inclement\nweather plan and are briefed on any required changes to the sequence of events or delays.\n2-25.

            "Chapter 3\nMemorial Events\nOVERVIEW\n3-1. The United States reveres those who have died in military service. Religious\nsupport honors the dead. Memorial ceremonies, services, and ramp ceremonies reflect\nthe emphasis the American people place on the worth and value of each individual.\nChaplains conduct these services and ceremonies at home station and while deployed,\nfulfilling a vital role in rendering tribute to America\u2019s sons and daughters who pay the\nultimate price serving the nation in the defense of freedom.\n3-2. Memorial events are a command responsibility. Commanders will conduct a\nmemorial event for every Soldier who dies while assigned to their unit, regardless of the\nmanner of death, including suicides. (See AR600-20 for more information on memorial\nevents.)\n3-3. As with any mission, thorough training, detailed planning, and extensive\nrehearsals ensure honors are rendered professionally and compassionately. Planning for\nmemorials should begin within 24 hours of notification of the death of a Soldier or\nauthorized civilian and include the commander, chaplain, command sergeant major,\nother relevant staff members, and participants. The unit or higher echelon headquarters\nmemorial SOP provides guidance for memorial events. In the absence of a\nhigher-echelon SOP, units should develop a memorial SOP. Since memorials are\nunplanned events that can happen both at home station and while deployed, units should\nconduct training to be prepared to execute a quality ceremony or service that does not\nappear rushed but proceeds smoothly while rendering honors for a deceased Soldier or\nauthorized civilian.\n3-4. The unit chaplain should ensure that the command understands the differences\nbetween a service and ceremony. Unit memorial ceremonies and services show respect\nto the service of Soldiers who have died and offer support to unit survivors. These\nmemorial events assist surviving Soldiers in dealing with the realities of death.\nMemorial events honor the military service and the contribution the Soldier made while\nin uniform. The unit memorial event allows surviving Soldiers a means for expressing\ntheir grief and enables in their healing.\n3-5. Unit commanders may request an exception to policy not to conduct a memorial\nevent through their command channels. The first general officer in the chain of\ncommand may approve the exception only when the deceased Soldier\u2014\n(cid:122) Has been convicted of a capital offense under Federal or State law for which\nthe person was sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole.\n(cid:122) Has been convicted of a serious offense, which is defined as a military or\ncivilian offense, which if prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military\n(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27) ATP 1-05.02 3-1",

(See AR600-20 for more\ninformation on Soldier deaths.)\nMEMORIAL CEREMONY\n3-6. A memorial ceremony is a command program with a ceremonial orientation.\nAttendance by members of a unit may be made mandatory. Although there are religious\naspects to a memorial ceremony, such as an invocation, the major focus will be on\nmilitary tributes and honors. A memorial ceremony may include a prelude, National\nAnthem, invocation, memorial tribute, readings,memorial prayers, silent tribute or roll\ncall, music, benediction, firing of volleys, and sounding of \u201cTaps.\u201d (See AR600-20 for\nmore information on memorial ceremonies.)\nNote. If Family is present and the unit includes the last roll call in the ceremony,\nthe chaplain prepares the Family for this portion of the event.\n3-7. The primary focus is on military tributes and honors and is sensitive to the needs\nof the Soldiers and unit morale. Though the faith group of the deceased is secondary, it\nmay contain some religious elements (including prayer or a brief message from a\nchaplain). Chaplain comments should emphasize hope and care to the unit members and\nif applicable, to the Family in attendance. Chaplain comments should reflect sensitivity\nthat not all in attendance share the same faith, denominational affiliation, or theological\nbeliefs.\n3-8. The memorial ceremony is a command function. Since the memorial ceremony is\npatriotic in nature, the background of the officiating chaplain is not of primary concern.\nService members of all faiths and denominations will attend the ceremony. The\npluralistic nature of those in attendance should be considered when planning the\nceremony. The ceremony should be planned to provide dignity and meaning to all who\nattend.\n3-9. Memorial ceremonies honor deceased Soldiers and provide an environment for\nsurvivors to grieve. The opportunity to grieve can provide healing and renewal to the\nliving that allows the unit to move forward with its collective mission. Therefore,\nmemorial ceremonies will be planned, rehearsed, and executed properly. Commanders\nhave responsibility for memorial ceremonies but will often delegate responsibility for\ntheir planning and execution to the chaplain. Chaplain sections and UMTs consult their\nunit or higher echelon headquarters SOP for specific tasks and seek guidance and\nassistance from their supervisory chaplain and religious affairs specialist.\n3-10. If a chapel is used for the ceremony, the facility NCOIC must neutralize the chapel\nand remove all religious symbols.

            "Memorial Events\nterminology is kept at a minimum. The contents of a memorial ceremony vary depending\non circumstances (whether deployed or at home station), current conditions in the OE,\nSOPs, and the commander\u2019s intent. The ceremony may be simple with only a few basic\nelements or very involved and formal. During the planning cycle, a unit may consider\nintegrating tribute videos and producing high quality copies of the bulletin, speaker\nremarks, and video for the Family. All comments (especially those given to the Family)\nneed to be reviewed before the ceremony for appropriate language and content. It is also\nadvisable to have participants rehearse their comments during rehearsals.\n3-11. In an OE,chaplains prepare to conduct the ceremony outside, without power, and\nthey consider the current security of the area. For planning purposes, chaplains\ndetermine what elements must be executed and balance them with the realities of the\nOE. Supervisory chaplains and religious affairs specialists should conduct training\nbefore any deployment.\nMEMORIAL SERVICE\n3-12. A memorial service is a command program with religious orientation. Attendance\nby members of a unit is strictly voluntary. A memorial service should be sensitive to the\ndeceased Soldier\u2019s faith group and to the needs of the Soldiers who voluntarily attend.\nThe focus of the service is on the faith of the deceased and if applicable, the wishes of\nthe surviving Family members. If possible, a chaplain of the faith group of the deceased\nwill conduct the service. This may not be possible if the unit is deployed. Chaplain\nsections and UMTs coordinate with higher echelon headquarters chaplains for religious\nsupport personnel available in theater. (See AR 600-20 for more information on\nmemorial services.)\n3-13. The elements of a memorial service may be similar to a memorial ceremony, and\ncircumstances should dictate an appropriate order of worship. A memorial service may\ninclude aprelude, invocation, scripture reading, meditation, prayer, silent tribute or roll\ncall, and benediction. (See AR600-20 for more information on memorial services.)\nNote. If the Family is present and the unit includes the last roll call in the service,\nprepare the Family for this portion of the event.\n3-14. Chaplain involvement in a memorial service is extensive. Any requirement for\nspecific rites and sacraments are guided by the deceased Soldier\u2019s faith group. The\nchaplain conducting the service may use any Scripture passage that is appropriate to the\nfaith of the deceased with an emphasis on providing hope and comfort to all in\nattendance. If other elements will be included in the service (for example, the last roll\ncall), the commander will conduct a thorough planning and rehearsal to seamlessly\nintegrate these elements into the memorial service.\n3-15. While the chaplain is the lead official in a memorial service, the chain of\ncommand may be included in the planning and execution of the service. Since a\nmemorial service is a religious service with elements of worship, support and setup are\nbased upon faith group requirements. During the planning phase, the officiating chaplain\n(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27) ATP 1-05.02 3-3",

Commanders of units deployed to combatant theaters or other contingency\noperations may conduct memorial events in the theater as the tactical situation permits\nand additional events upon return to home station. (See AR 600-20 for more information\non memorial events during deployment.) Rear detachment personnel may also conduct\nmemorial events for fallen Soldiers while their unit is still deployed. During the\ndeployment planning cycle, chaplains and religious affairs specialists should consider\nequipment and resources required to perform memorial events in a deployed\nenvironment. Based on an operational environment, the maturity of an operation, the\nmission of the unit, and the availability of an Army band bugler, a packing list may\ninclude a memorial stand, an appropriate digital selection of music (including a digital\nbugle), a generic script, and a pre-approved bulletin. The command or activity\nresponsible for providing Military Funeral Honors will conduct an active search for a\nbugler. If none is available, the designated person responsible for the funeral honors may\nauthorize instead the playing of a recording of \u201cTaps\u201d and will ensure that a quality\nrecording is available. (See AR 600-25 for more information on playing \u201cTaps.\u201d) The\nU.S. Army Band maintains downloadable recordings of Army bugle calls and other\nmusic useful for funerals and other ceremonies on their Web site.

A dignified transfer ceremony, also known as a ramp or fallen comrade ceremony,\nis a solemn event marking the journey home of a fallen U.S. Service member from an\nairfield in an area of operations. It is not a funeral and does not replace the requirements\nto support a memorial event for the Service member. The chaplain\u2019s participation in the\nramp ceremony is one of honor and is based on the commander\u2019s guidance. The chaplain\nis to be the religious leader for both the fallen Soldier or authorized civilian and the\npersonnel conducting the ramp ceremony. Army Music participation in this ceremony\nis based on higher echelon headquarters SOP, Air Force policy, or the commander\u2019s\nguidance. Army Music leaders should be prepared to conduct the ceremony under a\nvariety of conditions. Planning considerations will be based on the OE. Dignified\ntransfer ceremonies are a top priority for Army bands. (See ATP 1-19 for more\ninformation on Army Music support.)\n3-19. Unit commanders will plan and execute the ramp ceremony in accordance with\nhigher headquarters SOPs, Air Force policy, commander\u2019s guidance, national caveats\n(for multinational partners), current conditions in the OE, and the specific type of aircraft\nused to move the remains. The ramp ceremony is not a funeral and does not replace the\nrequirement to conduct a memorial event.

Conducting a memorial event requires synchronization of offices, individuals, and\nlogistics. This is often facilitated by the chaplain section or UMT under the authority of\nthe commander while simultaneously providing religious support to Soldiers, Family\nmembers, and leaders. Security concerns and continuance of mission must be factored\ninto the planning process, especially in an OE.\nA-2. The production of a timeline synchronizes tasks across staffs and external offices\ncreating unity of effort along one consolidated path. (See tables A-1 and A-2 on pages\nA-2 and A-3.)

Checklists assist staffs with synchronization of complex or infrequently\nconducted tasks. A checklist assigns tasks, provides suspenses, and can provide the\nagenda for an in-progress review. Providing clear instructions with a suspense facilitates\nregular updates where leaders provide additional guidance, make decisions, or\nreprioritize support to ensure mission success. The lists in paragraphs A-4 through A-6\nprovide a primer for each responsible echelon or individual to build a checklist which\nthen annotates office of responsibility, suspense, completion, and date of completion.\nCOMMAND TEAM\nA-4. Each echelon of command above the unit leadership has oversight and supervisory\nresponsibilities delineated in local memorial event SOPs.

There are required pieces of\nmusic such as the National Anthem and \u201cTaps.\u201d Some unit SOPs require unit songs,\nwhile some require instrumental versions or live music. Memorial events often have\nmusic playing as attendees enter the chapel as well as during the rendering of honors\nand dismissal.\nA-9. Each installation has music support options available if there are no prior\ncommitments which preclude support. One of these is the local band assigned to each\ninstallation. Another support option is the contracted musicians supporting the\ninstallation-wide religious support program as well as volunteers who might be available\nand willing to support the memorial event.\nA-10.DA PAM 220-90 provides a list of websites which provide approved\ndownloadable sound files which are cleared through legal authorities for any copyright\nissues. Chaplain sections and UMTs should download the files and store them locally\nrather than attempting to stream music during the conduct of an event.\nA-11.Some units have a set of approved and pre-recorded songs which are used to\nsupport memorial events. Additionally, most chaplain sections and UMTs have a digital\nbugle which plays both \u201cTaps\u201d and \u201cEcho Taps.\u201d\nA-12.If music is played as part of a slide-show tribute, it is important that the chaplain\nand command group listen to and approve the music list. While some music might\ncapture the memories or distinct personality of the deceased Soldier, not all music is\nappropriate for a memorial event setting, or might send a conflicting message regarding\nconduct which is inconsistent with the Army Ethic. (See ADP 1 for more information\non the Army Ethic.)\nMEMORIAL CEREMONY SET-UP\nA-13.Each unit has an SOP regarding the memorial stand set-up. It is essential that\nspecial care and attention is placed upon presenting a professional and dignified\nmemorial stand. Each item in the stand should be inspected carefully and cleaned to\nensure nothing detracts from the solemn nature of the memorial event. Stuffing paper\nand socks inside the boots to ensure they stand firmly, purchasing a new helmet cover,\nband, and unit markings, as well as preparing new identification tags all ensure a\nprofessional appearance.\nA-14.The memorial stand and colors are all set up during the rehearsal the day before\nthe event to provide time to identify deficiencies and correct them before the day of the\nmemorial event.

            "Appendix B\nMemorial Event Planning Considerations\nSuccessful planning for any event or task requires a clear\nunderstanding of the task, conditions, and standard. Conducting a\nmemorial event requires the same level of detail as RS and the\noperations process. (See ATP 1-05.01 for more details on RS and\nthe operations process.) The conditions under which a memorial\nevent are conducted often change rapidly and without any\nindication of a pending change. Anticipating potential changes in\nconditions and developing branches and sequels with corresponding\ndecision points provides options for responding as the running\nestimate is updated. This appendix serves as a primer for memorial\nevent planning considerations.\nFAMILY DYNAMICS\nB-1. Family members are invited to attend memorial events and units usually adjust\nthe date and time of a memorial event to accommodate their attendance. The casualty\nassistance officer and chaplain should assess whether there is potential for conflict or\ncontentious issues within the Family and make appropriate recommendations to the\ncommand on how to address or mitigate issues. Some items to consider include but are\nnot limited to\u2014\n(cid:122) Is there potential for conflict between the parents of the deceased and his or\nher spouse?\n(cid:122) Is there a former spouse in attendance as well as a current spouse?\n(cid:122) Are there children from a former relationship attending the event?\n(cid:122) Are there unresolved legal proceedings which could lead to contentious\ninteraction between attending Family members?\n(cid:122) Does the unit have additional escorts available to provide equitable support\nto conflicting portions of the Family?\n(cid:122) Is there another chaplain on standby in the Army service uniform should a\nneed arise?\n(cid:122) Is there a separate reception room available for portions of the attending\nFamily?\nEVENT LOCATION CONSIDERATIONS\nB-2. The location of the memorial event carries with it several variables which impact\nconduct of the event. Some of these variables are tied to an OE, while others are related\n(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27) ATP 1-05.02 B-1",

The primary concerns in an OE are safety issues. The consolidation of a large\ngroup of service members, DOD Civilians, and authorized civilians provides a lucrative\ntarget for potential adversaries. Conducting a memorial event in an OE requires\nconsideration of the following partial list of variables:\n(cid:122) What is the risk of indirect fire?\n(cid:122) Does the time of the event create schedule conflicts with ongoing missions\nand the ability of service members to attend?\n(cid:122) Is the facility a secure facility, and what are the access requirements?\n(cid:122) Is it necessary to coordinate with military police or expert ordinance disposal\npersonnel for a sweep of the facility?\n(cid:122) What is the required uniform posture?\n(cid:122) Is the loss catastrophic enough that the event needs to occur at a higher\nechelon?\n(cid:122) Do security conditions preclude conducting an event at a given location and\ntime?\n(cid:122) What are the minimum required items in the memorial stand under these\ncircumstances?\n(cid:122) Is it advisable to refrain from utilizing any sound projection systems?\n(cid:122) Should the firing of volleys and the playing of \u201cTaps\u201d be removed for sake\nof security concerns?\nCANTONMENT AREA\nB-4. Conducting a memorial event in a cantonment area generally provides more\nadministrative challenges and concerns than in an OE. Potential questions for\nconsideration include\u2014\n(cid:122) What approval is required for firing blanks during rehearsal and the event?\n(cid:122) Who must approve any alteration of traffic patterns and parking at the event\nlocation?\n(cid:122) What senior command group requires an invitation to the event?\n(cid:122) What senior command group has the approval authority for the date, time,\nand location of the event?\n(cid:122) What is the local SOP regarding use of various facilities?\n(cid:122) Are outdoor events permitted?\n(cid:122) What daily traffic patterns could impede efficient movement of personnel and\nequipment (for example, a school zone near the facility, roads closed during\nphysical fitness training, scheduled construction, or training exercises)?\nB-2 ATP 1-05.02 (cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27)",

Rehearsals allow leaders and their Soldiers to practice key aspects of the concept\nof operations. These actions help Soldiers orient themselves to their environment and\nother units before executing an operation. Rehearsals help Soldiers build a lasting mental\npicture of the sequence of key actions within an operation. Rehearsals are the\ncommander\u2019s tool to ensure staffs and subordinates understand the commander\u2019s intent\nand the concept of operations. They allow commanders and staffs to identify\nshortcomings in the plan not previously recognized. Rehearsals also contribute to\nexternal and internal coordination, as the staff identifies additional coordinating\nrequirements. (See FM 6-0 for more information on rehearsals.)\nB-7. Memorial events require extensive rehearsals. The set-up, walk through of the\nscheme of maneuver, and practice delivering remarks are all essential elements of a\nrehearsal. Appropriate time must be provided for in-progress reviews, a key leader\nrehearsal, a full rehearsal, and a full-dress rehearsal.\nIN-PROGRESS REVIEW\nB-8. This is a synchronization meeting where tasks are identified, assigned, and\nclarified. Or, the in-progress review is utilized to provide task status updates, request\nassistance, or receive additional clarification of guidance for the team and individuals.\nIf the commander identifies certain decision points, an in-progress review might be\nconducted to make a decision and ensure coordination of effort.

For memorial events, the ushers, escorts,\nand clean-up detail can acquire any missing equipment and supplies during the full\nrehearsal.\nFULL REHEARSAL\nB-10.A full rehearsal takes place the day before an event or earlier. All participants,\nequipment, supplies, and supporting personnel attend the full rehearsal. At this rehearsal,\nall aspects of the event are rehearsed. The memorial set-up is complete, uniforms are\ninspected, all audio-visual equipment and files are used, and the entire script is rehearsed\nwith careful attention to timing and cues.\nB-11.During the dress rehearsal, the command representatives might not rehearse all\niterations of the rehearsal. A representative might stand in during the initial iterations.\nHowever, the command team must rehearse the final full rehearsal to approve all\nelements of the event. It is also during this event where all remarks, comments, songs,\nmovements, and honors are rehearsed in their entirety.\nB-12.Participant uniforms are inspected during the full rehearsal. Participants generally\ndo not wear the uniform for the full rehearsal.\nFULL-DRESS REHEARSAL\nB-13.The day of the rehearsal or the day prior, the entire memorial ceremony is\nrehearsed in the designated uniform with all participants, equipment, supplies, and\nsupporting personnel. The full-dress rehearsal is identical to the memorial event, aside\nfrom the fact that the Family and attendees are not present.\nB-4 ATP 1-05.02 (cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27)",

            "Introduction\nATP 1-05.03 expands upon FM 1-05, Religious Support, in describing external\nadvisement as a required capability of chaplain sections and unit ministry teams.\nChaplain sections and unit ministry teams advise commanders at all echelons in\noperational environments and Army elements in direct support of operations. The\nreligious support \u201cadvise\u201d capability is divided into external and internal advisement.\nExternal advisement involves advising commands on the impact of religious and cultural\nbeliefs and practices of populations external to the unit. Chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists serving in joint force land component commands or joint task forces should\nrefer to JG 1-05, JP 3-0, and other joint publications for further guidance.\nATP 1-05.03 contains four chapters and three appendices\u2014\n\uf06c Chapter 1 describes external advisement and its relationship to the Chaplain\nCorps mission and core competencies.\n\uf06c Chapter 2 defines religious area analysis and its integration into the\noperational variables analysis as part of the military decisionmaking process,\nand it links external advisement to development of a running estimate.\n\uf06c Chapter 3 defines the religious impact assessment, its purpose and focal\npoints, the types of products often constituting a religious impact assessment.\nIt also describes the process for distributing and staffing a religious impact\nassessment and the follow-on modification of corollary products associated\nwith external advisement and the operations process.\n\uf06c Chapter 4 defines religion and Soldier and leader engagements and their\nimpacts on unit missions.\n\uf06c Appendix A provides an advisement model for developing a religious area\nanalysis utilizing the operational variables approach.\n\uf06c Appendix B defines the distinct roles and responsibilities associated with\nchaplains conducting Soldier and leader engagements.\n\uf06c Appendix C provides guidelines on integrating Soldier and leader\nengagements into the operations process.\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 v",

            "Chapter 1\nFundamentals of External Advisement\nCHAPLAIN CORPS MISSION\n1-1. The mission of the Army Chaplain Corps is to provide religious support (RS) to\nthe Army across the range of military operations by assisting commanders in providing\nfor the free exercise of religion and providing religious, moral, and ethical advisement\nand leadership. The Army Chaplain Corps possesses three core competencies (nurture\nthe living, care for the wounded, and honor the dead) executed through two required\ncapabilities, provide and advise. (See FM 1-05 for more information on the Army\nChaplain Corps mission. See DODD 1304.19 for more information on the Army\nChaplain Corps competencies.) External advisement occurs in this broader context. (See\nfigure 1-1 on page 1-2.)\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 1-1",
            "Chapter 1\nFigure 1-1. Religious support logic map\nRELIGIOUS ADVISEMENT\n1-2. As professional military religious advisors, chaplains advise commanders and\nstaffs on religion and its impact on all aspects of military operations. Chaplains do this\nby advising commanders on the impact of religion in their units. This is internal\nadvisement, and it is addressed in ATP 1-05.04. They will also advise commanders on\nhow religion impacts a unit\u2019s mission throughout its area of operations (AO). This is\nexternal advisement. (See figure 1-2.) The aim of external advisement is to help\ncommanders and staffs more clearly understand how religion shapes the battlefield and\nimpacts mission success. As they better understand religion in an operational\nenvironment (OE), they are better equipped to avoid offense and, even more important,\nbetter informed of the dynamics for building relationships of trust and forming valuable\npartnerships. Therefore, chaplains must diligently guard against external advisement\nactivities that compromise their noncombatant role.\n1-2 ATP 1-05.03 31 January 2019",
            "Fundamentals of External Advisement\nFigure 1-2. Religious advisement and the operations process\n1-3. Internally chaplains are responsible for advising commanders on the religious\npractices and requirements of Soldiers and authorized civilians in the command, often\nunderstood as religious accommodation. This can include identifying holy days, worship\nrequirements, dietary requirements, and wearing of religious garments. (See AR 600-20\nfor more information on religious accommodation.)\n1-4. Externally chaplains advise commanders on the specifics of the religious\nenvironment in their AO that may impact mission accomplishment. This includes\nanalysis, assessment, recommendations, engaging local populations, and training\ncommanders\u2019 formations to act appropriately as related to mission success.\nEXTERNAL ADVISEMENT AND AN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT\n1-5. The term \u201creligious\u201d refers to the system of beliefs and practices that give\nmeaning and purpose to people\u2019s lives. Religious refers to professing a set of beliefs\nconcerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, usually involving devotional\nand ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of\nhuman affairs. In its most basic form, religion identifies \u201cultimate concerns\u201d, those\nthings for which individuals or groups are willing to live or die. Therefore, religion\nshapes OEs, even those identified as primarily atheist or agnostic. As humans have\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 1-3",
            "Chapter 1\nconcerns that extend beyond mere survival, commanders need to know, and, wherever\npossible, understand how these concerns and values impact mission success. These\nvalues shape environments and inform commanders\u2019 abilities to develop partnerships\nand build relationships of trust.\n1-6. As part of planning, commanders consider how cultures and religions (their own\nand others in an operational area) impact operations. Understanding the culture and\nreligion of a particular society or group in a society can significantly improve a force\u2019s\nability to accomplish its mission. Understanding the culture of unified action partners is\ncrucial to building mutual trust and shared understanding. The core values of a culture\ncan be defined as deeply held beliefs of critical importance to its way of life. If chaplains\nand religious affairs specialists can determine the core values of a culture and reward or\ncomplement those values, this will assist chaplains in operating with the members of\nthat culture. If those values are threatened or belittled, a cultural impasse may be created\nthat will negatively impact the conduct of unit operations.\n1-7. Because religion is often an integral part of the values set of a culture, mission\npreparation and analysis should examine the religions and religious groups in an AO.\nReligious beliefs, leaders, and institutions are central to the worldview of many\nsocieties. The impact of religion on a local population must be considered when planning\nany operation. Chaplains participate in operational planning and advise commanders and\nstaffs on matters as appropriate, consistent with their noncombatant status. This includes\nindigenous religions in the AO, holy days that could impact military operations, and the\nimpact of local religious leaders, organizations, and religious structures.\n1-8. Religion has the ability to shape an OE and therefore to impact the operations\nprocess. As the religious staff advisor, chaplains execute RS planning by actively\nintegrating into the operations process. Chaplains will maintain their non-combatant\nstatus while integrating their expertise on religion into the military decisionmaking\nprocess (MDMP). (See table 1-1.) Chaplains and religious affairs specialists may work\nin boards, bureaus, centers, cells, and working groups to integrate their respective\nexpertise and knowledge with the collective expertise of staffs to focus on specific\nproblem sets and provide coherent staff recommendations to commanders.\n1-4 ATP 1-05.03 31 January 2019",

Chaplains and religious\naffairs specialists advise units on the impact derogatory terms or negative treatment of\nindigenous people will have on mission success. The unit ministry team (UMT) will also\nadvise commanders and staffs and train formations on the elements of religion related\nto respecting local populations. The religious advisor capability is essential as the\nChaplain Corps supports the commander\u2019s operation. Military leaders rely on their\nchaplains to help them navigate the complexities of religious factors in an OE. While\nother staff sections may advise commanders on religion in an OE, including the\nintelligence section and civil affairs teams, the chaplain is the only one who does so\nfrom the perspective of a religious leader. As credentialed professionals and religious\nleaders, chaplains are relationship experts, experienced with demonstrating respect and\ncare for others. When introduced as such, chaplains can help open lines of\ncommunication for commanders and staffs to accomplish their missions. This implies\nchaplain sections and UMTs are fully integrated with other staff sections to maximize\ncooperation and staff work.\n1-6 ATP 1-05.03 31 January 2019",

As a framework for the execution of the required capability to advise the\ncommand on religion and military operations, chaplains and religious affairs specialists\nmust understand the term \u201cworldview.\u201d A worldview is developed through\nsocio-economic and cultural development. Worldview influences attitudes, beliefs, and\ncharacter and ultimately affects behavior. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists\nhave a role in analyzing, educating, and advising commanders and their staffs in\ndeveloping an objective worldview. The worldview of a chaplain or religious affairs\nspecialist impacts their ability to look objectively at the beliefs and behaviors of others,\nwhich influences their execution of the external advisement capability. A worldview\nis\u2014\n\uf06c The lens by which people receive, interpret and process information and\nevents in their lives.\n\uf06c Shaped by the origins, upbringing, education, experience, ideology, religion,\nand belief system of each individual.\n\uf06c A perspective which helps determine an individual\u2019s reality. A worldview\ndetermines how people will behave in certain circumstances. When analyzing\nworldview, chaplains consider\u2014\nFor what core values are they willing to fight?\n\uf06e\nWhat is their perception of truth?\n\uf06e\nWhat actions do they believe are morally right and wrong?\n\uf06e\n1-14. In recent years the term \u201cmetanarrative\u201d has been used to describe the story or\nunderstanding that informs a worldview. Research, Soldier and leader engagements, and\ncareful analysis help UMTs begin to understand the components of the metanarrative\ninforming local populations\u2019 worldviews.\n1-15. Different religious groups and cultures have different worldviews which can\nimpact military operations. In some societies, there are multiple religions in an AO, with\none or more dominant. As a religious advisor, analyzing an operation with the belief that\nall individuals are the same will lead to flawed understanding and have negative\nconsequences. As a religious advisor, chaplains can increase a commander\u2019s situational\nunderstanding by determining behavior and sources of conflict and recommending\ncourses of action to resolve it.\n1-16. The role of an advisor is to provide accurate and objective information to enable\ncommanders and staffs to achieve mission success. It is not to judge or compare another\nreligion to one\u2019s own personal beliefs. Everyone in a unit has a worldview that is the\nresult of upbringing, choices, learning, and personal experience. For chaplains and for\nmany religious affairs specialists, a personal worldview is closely connected to faith.\nThey see things through their personal faith and beliefs. Chaplains and religious affairs\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 1-7",
            "Chapter 1\nspecialists need to realize that their worldview can affect their ability to act as an\nimpartial advisor to their commander and affect their ability to look objectively at the\nbeliefs and behaviors of others. If they spend too much energy and emotion in comparing\nother\u2019s beliefs and behaviors to their own, chaplains and religious affairs specialists take\nthe risk of losing objectivity and may not be able to give commanders the facts required\nfor mission planning. Objectivity does not imply religious or ethical relativism. One may\n(and often will) personally disagree with beliefs and practices of populations in\ncommanders\u2019 AOs. That said, only objective analysis helps commanders and staffs\nunderstand how religion shapes an OE.\n1-17. An analysis of indigenous groups in an OE focuses on how their religion impacts\nthe mission. Multinational partners may also have significantly different religious and\ncultural worldviews that must be considered for an assessment of their impact on the\nmission. Careful religious analysis will help commanders and staffs avoid thinking that\neveryone living in an AO is the same. Commanders and staffs consider\u2014\n\uf06c What is the group\u2019s worldview? Is it consistent in the group? All cultures\nhave a shared worldview that gives them a distinct identity, but no two\nindividuals in a group have the exact same worldview. It is important to\nidentify where certain individuals may have significant individual\ndifferences.\n\uf06c Are there significant variations in the group based on individual upbringing,\nexperiences, and learning, and what is that impact on unit operations? It is\nthese variations of an individual\u2019s worldview that can be used to have a\npositive impact on operations.\n1-18. The religious advisor\u2019s integration into the operations process can help\ncommanders and staffs gain a better understanding of how the local population thinks\nand behaves. This may help commanders and staffs better predict how unit operations\nwill impact the local population and vice versa.\nEXTERNAL ADVISEMENT AND DECISIVE ACTION\n1-19. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists support and advise commanders\nthroughout the operations process (planning, preparation, execution, and assessment) in\ntheir area of expertise. In decisive action (offense, defense, stability, and defense support\nof civil authorities), chaplains and religious affairs specialists work in the operations\nprocess to integrate the external focus of the religious advisor capability with other staff\nactivities by providing relevant data on the impact of religion on unit operations. (See\nfigure 1-3.) Situational understanding is the product of applying analysis and\ndiscernment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the\noperational and mission variables to facilitate decisionmaking (ADP 5-0). The chaplain\nas religious advisor can impact the commander\u2019s situational understanding through three\nproducts: a running estimate, a religious area analysis, and a religious impact\nassessment.\n1-8 ATP 1-05.03 31 January 2019",

These products include running estimates,\nreligious area analysis, religious impact assessments, and products associated with the\noperations process.\nEXTERNAL ADVISEMENT AND THE RUNNING ESTIMATE\n1-21. Effective plans and successful execution hinge on accurate and current running\nestimates. A running estimate is the continuous assessment of the current situation used\nto determine if the current operation is proceeding according to the commander\u2019s intent\nand if planned future operations are supportable (ADP 5-0). Staff sections maintain a\nrunning estimate focused on how their areas of expertise are postured to support future\noperations. Because an estimate may be needed at any time, running estimates must be\ninitially developed and continuously revised throughout an operation. For chaplain\nsections and UMTs, the running estimate both informs and is informed by the religious\narea analysis.\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 1-9",

Religious area analysis is researching and collecting data from an OE related to\nreligion and organizing that data using the operational variables: political, military,\neconomic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time\n(PMESII-PT). (See appendix A for more details on the operational variables.) Religious\narea analysis collects as much information about religion in an AO as time allows from\nas wide a variety of resources as possible. The religious area analysis is often a 10 to\n12-page product which informs the religious impact assessment. The religious area\nanalysis process enables chaplains and religious affairs specialists to disseminate the\nanalyzed information in a usable format for use by commanders, staffs, and other\nchaplains and religious affairs specialists.

The religious impact assessment determines how religion in an AO impacts a\nunit\u2019s mission by determining how religion informs stability and security or is used to\ndestabilize the legitimate government. The unit chaplain and religious affairs specialist\ndevelop a 1 to 2-page religious impact assessment based upon the information in the\nrunning estimate, the religious area analysis, and information from other staff sections\nor higher echelon headquarters.

The religious area analysis is a comprehensive planning method integrated into\nthe operations process to collect and analyze data (including religious factors) on the\nreligious histories, issues, leaders, attitudes, customs, beliefs, and practices in an AO\nand their impact on unit operations. Analysis of the religious factors in an AO can\nproduce a religious impact assessment that increases the commander\u2019s situational\nunderstanding and supports the information and operational planning requirements\nneeded during the MDMP.\n2-2. Religious area analysis as a product is generally 10 to 12-pages of either a\nnarrative document or slides. The format for a religious area analysis is driven by the\nunit and the commander\u2019s preference for receiving information and making decisions.\nWhile the format might change, the method for developing the content remains the same.\nAs an overview and for general planning purposes, chaplain sections and UMTs\u2014\n\uf06c Analyze and assess the relevancy and timeliness of the information as it is\ncollected. They consider how religious factors impact the commander\u2019s\ndecision-making process and the unit\u2019s current and future operations.\n\uf06c Consider their limitations. They understand that while some may not be\nsubject matter experts, all RS personnel are required to provide religious\nanalysis to their commander.\n\uf06c Avoid bias. In order to advise about the impact of a religion, they do not pass\njudgment on the value of that belief or practice. They do not determine the\ntruth of another religion before providing factual information about that\nreligion to the commander. The role of an advisor is to provide the\ncommander with accurate information about a religion. It is not appropriate\nto discredit the teachings of another religion and its potential impact on the\nmilitary mission.\n\uf06c Remember that they are advisors. Since a chaplain is one person among many\nwho advise commanders, chaplains must think in terms of how they can\nsupport the overall planning process as a member of a team.\nGENERAL PLANNING GUIDELINES\n2-3. When developing a religious area analysis, chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists should follow these general steps: anticipate situations, gather facts, and\nanalyze, assess, and categorize information into a relevant product.\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 2-1",
            "Chapter 2\n2-4. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists anticipate situations and locations. They\nare proactive instead of reactive. Executing a mission somewhere around the world\nrequires advance preparation and planning. If a unit is geographically oriented, or if a\nunit knows in advance where it is deploying, chaplains and religious affairs specialists\nfocus religious area analysis preparation efforts in that AO. As a general planning\nprinciple, chaplains and religious affairs specialists should keep up on current events\nand religious issues in the news that may have an impact on military operations.\nChaplains and religious affairs specialists consider these questions when anticipating\nsituations:\n\uf06c What is happening in the unit\u2019s AO?\n\uf06c What are the \u201chotspots\u201d? Hotspots include not only combat, acts of terror and\nother forms of conflict, but also natural disasters (floods, hurricanes,\nearthquakes) and movements of dislocated civilians.\n\uf06c What is happening in the AO? Once deployed, chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists need to maintain situational awareness in the unit AO.\n2-5. When chaplains and religious affairs specialists gather facts, they collect\ninformation selectively.

They do not provide their commanders or staffs a\nlarge document or a database detailing everything known about the indigenous religions\nof the AO. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists need to be selective and carefully\nanalyze the data before its input into the operations process.\n2-7. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists assess the religious factors in an AO.\nThis assessment is used to determine if these religious factors impact the current or\nfuture military mission.\n2-8.

Upon receipt of a mission, chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists filter religious data categorized by the operational variables into relevant\ninformation with respect to the mission. The operational variables are used to\nunderstand, analyze, and describe an OE and enable chaplains to brief commanders on\nhow religion in these variables could impact the mission. (See ADP 1-01 for more\ninformation on operational variables. See appendix A for more detail on the religious\narea analysis and the operational variables.)\n2-11.

An\nanalysis of civil considerations and their impact on the unit mission is critical for mission\nsuccess. Civil considerations encompass infrastructure, civilian institutions, and\nattitudes and activities of civilian leaders, populations, and organizations in the AO and\ntheir impact on the mission. Civil considerations are linked to operational variables.\nCivil considerations can be categorized and analyzed using six characteristics: areas,\nstructures, capabilities, organizations, people and events:\n\uf06c Areas. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists analyze religious enclaves\n(locations of different religious groups) or areas with religious significance\n(nature preserves, holy sites, and areas with historical religious significance).\n\uf06c Structures. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists identify religious\ncultural sites (churches, mosques, temples, shrines, and religious education\nfacilities, cemeteries, and other sites with religious significance).\n\uf06c Capabilities include the ability of local authorities to provide the local\npopulation with key functions or services including religious worship and\neducation.\n\uf06c Organizations include nonmilitary groups or institutions in an AO that\ninfluence and interact with the local population, the unit, and each other\n(including religious organizations, both local and international, NGOs, and\nintergovernmental organizations).\n\uf06c People. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists identify religious leaders,\nindigenous religions, local languages, and local customs.\n\uf06c Events.

(For\na detailed running estimate format, see ATP 1-05.01.) The running estimate is a valuable\ntool for chaplains and religious affairs specialists to record their assessments,\nconsiderations, and assumptions related to the religious factors that impact current and\nfuture operations.\n2-20. During execution, chaplains and religious affairs specialists monitor the situation\nto identify changes in conditions, assess the impact, and update both the running\nestimate and religious area analysis. (See figure 1-3 on page 1-9.) They determine if the\nchanges in the religious factors affect the overall conduct of operations or the chaplain\u2019s\npart of it. They consider if the changes are significant. Finally, they identify if the\nchanged conditions represent variances from the order\u2014especially the opportunities and\nrisks. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists use running estimates to look for\nindicators of variances that affect their areas of expertise.\n2-21.

The religious impact assessment determines how religion in an AO impacts the\nunit\u2019s mission by assessing how religion informs stability and security or is used to\ndestabilize the legitimate government. The chaplain and religious affairs specialist\ndevelop a 1 to 2-page religious impact assessment based upon the information in the\nrunning estimate, the religious area analysis, and information from other staff sections\nor higher echelon headquarters. (See appendix A for more detail.)\nFOCAL POINTS\n3-2. The brief nature of a religious impact assessment demands a clear focal point to\neffectively support commanders, staffs, and Soldiers in both understanding and\nimplementing the advisement. Therefore, the reason for the religious impact assessment\nmust be clarified before drafting, writing, staffing, and distributing it. Understanding the\npurpose of the religious impact assessment affects which elements of the operational\nvariables are highlighted in the product. (See appendix A for a detailed list of questions\nfor consideration in building a religious impact assessment.)\n3-3. For Soldier and leader engagements, the religious impact assessment should focus\non identity of key leaders, issues of importance to those leaders, delineation of\ntheological differences across groups or leaders in attendance, and the relationship of\nthat individual or group with external actors in the AO or the region. This document\nshould be inside the 1 to 2-page construct. It should also provide information in a concise\nand easily internalized manner, as the product cannot be used during the conduct of a\nSoldier and leader engagement, especially if members of potentially opposed groups are\npresent.\n3-4. For general purpose guidance to a formation conducting operations during\nreligious holidays, festivals, or observances, the religious impact assessment might take\nthe form of a laminated quick reference card with guidelines for unified action partners.\nThis card should describe normal behaviors, customs which should be observed, and a\ngeneral explanation of the purpose of the observance and its importance to the\npopulation.\n3-5. Religious impact assessments might also focus on physical locations, including\nbuildings, areas, or routes. These sites may have permanent or temporary significance\ntied to religious calendars. These religious impact assessments need to clearly identify\nthe times, places, and significance of the sites to the local population. As with any\nreligious impact assessment, explaining the normal behaviors, religious significance,\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 3-1",
            "Chapter 3\nand associated recommended behaviors of unified action partners is crucial to an\neffective religious impact assessment.\nPRODUCTS\n3-6. A religious impact assessment is most often a 1 to 2-page document using an\ninformation paper format. It can also take the form of a quick reference information card\n(laminated and distributed across a formation). A religious impact assessment can also\nserve as a product in an operation order or fragmentary order. (See FM 6-0 for more\ndetails on information papers.)\n3-7. While formats for products exist in continuity files and training products at the\nUnited States Army Chaplain Center and School, each unit develops standard formats\nfor command products. These formats reflect the preferred method by which leaders and\nSoldiers gather information, make decisions, and communicate priorities. Using the\nestablished formats communicate professionalism and synchronization with\ncommanders and staffs, which enhances rapid understanding, assimilation, and\nexecution of advisement.\n3-8. Products for Soldier and leader engagements are generally provided at least 2 to\n3 days before an engagement and are the result of collaborative staff work. The chaplain\nsection or UMT should anticipate multiple revisions and the possibility that only\nportions of their contributions will be included in the final product. This product is then\nprovided only to key leaders and essential personnel due to the potentially sensitive\nnature of its content. These products are usually not carried into a Soldier and leader\nengagement.\n3-9. When interaction with the local population increases, or religious observances\ndrive a change in the normal behavior of the local population, it is helpful to provide a\none-page data sheet. A one-page data sheet can then be laminated and carried by\nindividuals or posted in work areas or vehicles. These products are regularly distributed\nduring the operations process.\nDISTRIBUTION AND STAFFING\n3-10. Religious area analysis products fall into a number of options for distribution and\nstaffing due to the distinct nature of the requirements they fulfill. Chaplain sections and\nUMTs need to understand the scope and purpose of each religious impact assessment\nand ensure proper staffing and distribution are implemented to best support their\ncommander and their unit.\n3-11. A product requested by a senior leader might go directly from the chaplain section\nor UMT to the senior leader with minimal staffing or oversight. For this reason, chaplain\nsections and UMTs need to develop effective relationships with their higher echelon\nheadquarter\u2019s chaplain section or UMT as well as subject matter experts across the Army\nto facilitate rapid assistance and validation of material.\n3-12. The civil affairs operations staff officer serves as the lead agent for civil-military\ninteraction at brigade echelons. This often means the civil affairs operations staff officer\n3-2 ATP 1-05.03 31 January 2019",
            "Religious Impact Assessments\nserves as the lead agent of working groups, boards, and planning teams for civil affairs\noperations. The chaplain section and UMT need to closely coordinate with the civil\naffairs operations staff officer for either development of a religious impact assessment\nor integration of religious factors in civil affairs products.\n3-13. Anticipated external advisement on religious holidays and observances should be\nplanned with religious impact assessments produced and prepared for distribution well\nin advance of the holiday or observance. Once a chaplain section or UMT receives word\nof a deployment, joins a regionally aligned unit, or anticipates potential deployment to\na geographic combatant command\u2019s area of responsibility, it begins planning and\nresearch for a religious area analysis. Once a rough religious area analysis is produced,\na list of religious observances and holidays should be compiled with a religious impact\nassessment product for each event or population group in the anticipated AO. These\nproducts should be updated as the event date approaches and published as part of the\nunit operations process. An example of this would be a one-page Ramadan information\nproduct. Preparing a product months in advance facilitates rapid distribution to\nsubordinate units 2 to 3 weeks before the beginning of observances in an AO. (Each\nechelon should add two weeks to the distribution schedule per echelon above brigade in\nwhich they reside.)\nMODIFICATION\n3-14. The religious impact assessment informs and guides Soldier and leader\nengagements as part of a cyclical process coordinated and synchronized with the staff.\nLike the running estimate and RS analysis, the religious impact assessment undergoes\nrevisions, updates, and potential replacement following certain activities or acquisition\nof information and increased situational understanding.\n3-15. Immediately following any Soldier and leader engagement, the religious impact\nassessment should be assessed for accuracy and impact upon the Soldier and leader\nengagement. This data is then used to update both the religious area analysis and current\nworking religious impact assessment. Additionally, the Soldier and leader engagement\nmight lead to subsequent Soldier and leader engagements with other leaders which\nrequires religious impact assessments for those Soldier and leader engagements.\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 3-3",

            "Chapter 4\nSoldier and Leader Engagement\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION IN SOLDIER AND\nLEADER ENGAGEMENTS\n4-1. Chaplains execute two required capabilities, provide and advise, across the range\nof military operations (from stable peace to general war) and during the conduct of\ndecisive action (including simultaneous offensive, defensive, and stability or defense\nsupport of civil authorities tasks). Decisive action requires aggressive, flexible,\nreal-time, and responsive RS by chaplains and religious affairs specialists at all echelons.\n4-2. Chaplains serve as the principal advisors to commanders for all issues regarding\nthe impact of religion on military operations. Chaplains provide commanders this\ncapability due to their theological education combined with their operational\nexperiences. While chaplains prioritize provision of RS to Soldiers and\ncommand-authorized civilians, chaplains and religious affairs specialists must be\nprepared to support the commander\u2019s need for advisement as part of a collaborative\neffort across the staff. (See FM 1-05 for more information on advisement of\ncommanders.)\n4-3. Religion is more than a resource and tool used to influence. In many areas of the\nworld, it is a powerful force that defines people and influences their actions. The power\nof religion is demonstrated by religious and cultural leaders who are religiously\nmotivated to influence conflicts toward a peaceful resolution or to incite violence.\nResiding in local communities, their religious identities help them influence diverse\naudiences. These leaders include tribal leaders, militants, leaders from other religious\ngroups, religious opinion makers, government officials, authoritative narrative\ninterpreters, preachers, curates of souls, shamans, priests, ministers, mullahs, rabbis,\nimams, ayatollahs, and religious social critics.\n4-4. All assets and capabilities at a commander\u2019s disposal can serve as\ninformation-related capabilities and communicate to selected audiences to varying\ndegrees. Commanders lead information operations (IO) and receive advice and support\nfrom their staffs. Information operations are the integrated employment, during military\noperations, of information-related capabilities in concert with other lines of operation to\ninfluence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision making of adversaries and potential\nadversaries while protecting our own (JP 3-13). The staffs\u2019 role includes coordination.\nA commander uses IO to ensure actions, themes, and messages compliment and\nreinforce each other to accomplish objectives. (See FM 3-13 for a detailed discussion of\nIO.)\n4-5. A Soldier and leader engagement is interpersonal Service-member interactions\nwith audiences in an area of operations (FM 3-13). It can occur as an opportunity, face-\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 4-1",
            "Chapter 4\nto-face encounter on the street, or as a scheduled meeting. Soldier and leader\nengagements are not single, isolated events but part of a larger comprehensive and\nintegrated program of activities. Soldiers\u2019 actions are among the most potent factors in\nsuccessfully executing IO. Soldier and leader engagements enable commanders to\ninteract with a local population and are essential for the success of U.S. security interests\nworldwide. The commander\u2019s Soldier and leader engagement strategy is executed by\nthe commander to establish or maintain relationships with relevant entities in a country\nto enhance civil and military cooperation, further the national security interests of the\nU.S. and the host nation, shape an AO to influence the outcome of operations, and deny\nadversaries the support of the local population.\n4-6. Soldiers and leaders conduct engagements in an AO to provide information or to\ninfluence attitudes, perceptions, and behavior. These engagements provide a venue for\nbuilding relationships, resolving conflict, and conveying information. These\nengagements often require the distinct capabilities of specialized teams with\nmultidisciplinary perspectives. These teams are tasked with interacting with the local\npopulation to ascertain civil and society needs and problems, address security concerns,\nand to form links between the population, military, and interagency partners. (See\nATP 3-55.4 for more information on execution of Soldier and leader engagements.)\n4-7. When directed by their commanders, chaplains, as religious leaders and religious\nstaff advisors, execute Soldier and leader engagements as part of the commander\u2019s\noverall Soldier and leader engagement strategy. For chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists, a Soldier and leader engagement is any command-directed contact or\ninteraction where the chaplain, as the command\u2019s religious representative, meets with a\nleader on matters of religion. This engagement is a focused and narrow mission in the\nrequired advise capability that addresses religion in human activity without employing\nreligion to achieve military advantage. The term engagement recognizes that resolution\nof problems in an OE can be addressed through human interaction, dialogue, and\nrelationships. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists are not limited to dialogue with\nindigenous clergy. While it includes directed interaction with NGOs or other\nstakeholders the commander may designate, the main focus of the engagement is on\nreligion and its impact on operations. (See JG 1-05 for more information on Soldier and\nleader engagement.)\nNote. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists conducting Soldier and leader\nengagements will not collect information for the purpose of intelligence. While\nchaplains and religious affairs specialists may gather information while\nconducting Soldier and leader engagements, they will not serve as intelligence\ncollectors. The IO officer typically has oversight and management of the Soldier\nand leader engagement program. The chaplain section or UMT coordinates with\nthe IO officer during preparation for and debriefing the outcome of engagements\nto facilitate shared understanding among staff members.\n4-8. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists meet to build relationships of mutual\ntrust and respect, promote human rights, and deepen cultural understanding between unit\nmembers and the local population. Engagements facilitate communication between\n4-2 ATP 1-05.03 31 January 2019",
            "Soldier and Leader Engagement\nindigenous leaders and U.S. forces. The execution of an engagement begins with an\nunderstanding of two terms: dialogue and discussion:\n\uf06c Dialogue means\u2014\nTo inquire to learn.\n\uf06e\nTo unfold shared meaning.\n\uf06e\nTo integrate multiple perspectives.\n\uf06e\nTo uncover and examine assumptions.\n\uf06e\nTo build trust and establish credibility.\n\uf06e\n\uf06c Discussion means\u2014\nTo tell, sell, or persuade.\n\uf06e\nTo gain agreement on one meaning.\n\uf06e\nTo evaluate and select the best.\n\uf06e\nTo justify or defend assumptions.\n\uf06e\n4-9. The intentions of dialogue and discussion are different. For engagements,\ndialogue supports the best outcome. Dialogue requires\u2014\n\uf06c Attentive listening for long periods of time. This involves a complete shift in\nmindset. Instead of telling others what they think, chaplains and religious\naffairs specialists inquire of them what they think. Attentive listening\ninvolves an active approach to demonstrating to others that chaplains and\nreligious affairs specialists are hearing and understanding them. It includes\nthe ability to maintain intense mental focus and concentration on the topic at\nhand.\n\uf06c Inquiring of others and paraphrasing their ideas when chaplains and religious\naffairs specialists might otherwise want to attack, defend, or explain.\n\uf06c Delving into one\u2019s thoughts and separating assumptions from facts. Dialogue\nrequires the ability to penetrate into others\u2019 assumptions and worldviews to\nuncover the framework that governs their behavior.\n4-10. It is also important to link dialogue with consistent behavior. When dialogue is\ninconsistent with observable behavior (including unit actions in an AO), Soldiers and\nleaders can lose credibility, which negatively impacts military operations. The role of\nchaplains as religious staff advisors to commanders becomes critical during the\noperations process. Some guiding principles for chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists conducting Soldier and leader engagements include\u2014\n\uf06c Showing respect for cultural and religious traditions of the host country.\n\uf06c Building relationships as a foundation for mission accomplishment.\n\uf06c Using indigenous methods and processes for resolving conflict.\n4-11. As an overview, when conducting a Soldier and leader engagement the chaplain\nand religious affairs specialist will\u2014\n\uf06c Accomplish the mission only at the order of the commander.\n\uf06c Fully participate in the staff planning and rehearsal of the engagement team.\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 4-3",

Commanders and chaplains must follow these parameters:\n\uf06c Chaplains do not take any action that threatens a chaplain\u2019s non-combatant\nstatus or violates the law of war. This means that\u2014\nChaplains do not function as intelligence collectors, and they will not be\n\uf06e\ntasked to gather intelligence or engage in manipulation or military\ndeception operations.\nChaplains do not take the lead in formal negotiations.\n\uf06e\nChaplains do not identify targets for combat operations.\n\uf06e\n\uf06c Chaplains and religious affairs specialists do not use engagements to\nproselytize.\n\uf06c Chaplains should coordinate Soldier and leader engagements with other staff\nand non-staff agencies of the command.\n\uf06c Chaplains and religious affairs specialists conduct Soldier and leader\nengagements in a manner that does not obligate the commander, the unit, or\nother U.S. or unified action partners.\nENGAGEMENTS AND THE LEVELS OF WAR\n4-13. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists conduct Soldier and leader\nengagements across the range of military operations. Engagements occur at the strategic,\noperational, and tactical levels. At all levels, chaplains meet with religious leaders to\nlisten and acquire an understanding of religious factors for their commanders. Chaplains\nalso work with IO working groups because of the required capabilities and their religious\nexpertise.\n4-14. At the tactical echelon, Soldier and leader engagements conducted by chaplains\nand religious affairs specialists are interpersonal interactions between U.S. military and\nlocal nationals and leaders to build relationships. Chaplains operating at the tactical level\nprovide insight into the religious situation at the grassroots level, which can be crucial\nto understanding how to foster sustainable stability and security. Chaplains engage with\nlocal religious leaders or host-nation military clergy (including during training).\nChaplains at brigade echelons and below may be involved in civil-military projects such\nas building schools and religious facilities or visiting hospitals with other engagement\nteams who are addressing the needs of the community.

Chaplains operating at the operational echelon supervise the chaplains and\nreligious affairs specialists operating at the tactical echelon, coordinate for their support\nand awareness, and make connections across higher echelon headquarters\u2019 lines of\neffort. They inform higher echelon commanders of engagement activities in their AO\nand provide information for staffs. Operational echelon engagement activities include\u2014\n\uf06c Overseeing subordinate chaplain and religious affairs specialist tactical\nSoldier and leader engagements.\n\uf06c Coordinating support for Soldier and leader engagements conducted by\nsubordinate chaplains and religious affairs specialists.\n\uf06c Linking tactical engagements with strategic initiatives.\n\uf06c Providing and maintaining a religious area analysis and religious impact\nassessment of the region for the command.\n\uf06c Advising and assisting staff working groups.\n4-16. Chaplains operating at the strategic echelon can be important partners for their\ndiplomatic colleagues. They promote the voices of religious minorities and advocate for\nhuman rights. They can engage with intergovernmental and nongovernmental\norganizations, and they can foster reconciliation efforts among divided groups. Strategic\nechelon engagement activities include\u2014\n\uf06c Collaborating and coordinating subordinate religious engagement strategies\nand training in theater.\n\uf06c Advising staff working groups of influential religious leaders, key religious\nsites, and religious themes.\n\uf06c Advising on training of religious and cultural affairs officers or chaplaincies\nof other nations.\n\uf06c When authorized, establishing relationships with organizations to enhance\ncapabilities, promote interoperability, and advise commanders to support\nmission requirements.

            "Chapter 4\nSoldier and leader engagement strategy. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists are\nkey participants in the MDMP, as they determine the concept of RS employed to\ncomplete this RS mission. Chaplains also work in established systems to integrate their\nexpertise and knowledge with the collective expertise of staff members to focus on a\nspecific problem set. When directed by commanders, this may include staff input of\nreligious issues to boards, bureaus, centers, cells, and working groups. During relief in\nplace and transfer of authority, chaplains and religious affairs specialists ensure relevant\ndata (including reports, contacts, databases, standards, and lessons learned) is accurately\ntransferred to the gaining unit.\n4-18. An effective engagement is the result of sound analysis of the commander\u2019s intent\nand the chaplain\u2019s ability to advise the command on the impact of religion. An\nengagement conducted by chaplains and religious affairs specialists is a\ncommand-directed task. Like any other mission, chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists use the operations process (planning, preparation, execution and assessment)\nto ensure effective engagement execution. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists\nachieve mission success with sufficient planning, quality preparation, disciplined\nexecution, relevant assessment, and continuous leader involvement.\n4-19. Planning is the first step in the process. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists\ntranslate their commander\u2019s directed intent into engagement proficiency tasks.\nNominations for proposed engagements emerge from an analysis of the commander\u2019s\ninformation requirements; the commander\u2019s top priorities, the lines of effort, media\nreports, and the calendar of significant religious events.\n4-20. Preparations are the transition from planning an engagement to completing the\nnecessary support requirements for a successful execution of a Soldier and leader\nengagement. Preparation requires rehearsals and coordination for resources and support.\nRehearsals help chaplains and religious affairs specialists involved in an engagement\nevent to understand their roles and responsibilities and understand how to conduct an\nengagement.\n4-21. The successful execution of an engagement is the focus of planning and\npreparation. Execution is accomplishing a mission to standard. Recovery, reporting, and\nknowledge management are part of execution. Recovery includes inspecting and\nmaintaining equipment and Soldiers, and accounting for equipment, weapons, and\nsensitive items.\n4-22. Assessment refers to a leader\u2019s judgment of a team\u2019s ability to perform its\nessential tasks and, ultimately, its ability to accomplish its engagement mission.\nEvaluation refers to the process used to measure the demonstrated ability of individuals\non a team to accomplish specified objectives in that mission. At the completion of an\nengagement mission, chaplains and religious affairs specialists measure the\neffectiveness of the engagement. The engagement team assesses and evaluates all\naspects of the engagement, including the planning, preparation, and execution. The\npreferred mixed method of evaluation incorporates both qualitative and quantitative\nmeasures of effect. After action reviews identify successes and challenges and apply\nobservations, insights, and lessons learned to future engagements.\n4-6 ATP 1-05.03 31 January 2019",

Chaplains advise commanders regarding the impact of religion on unit operations.\nThe categories listed in paragraphs A-2 through A-10 give general parameters for\npreparing a religious area analysis and developing the overall religious impact\nassessment. When researching and analyzing the OE, chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists analyze the religious factors in their AO and weigh the impact of their\ninfluence on the unit\u2019s mission. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists analyze the\nreligious factors and provide an assessment to the commander.\nNote. The operational variables serve as a common framework to categorize\ninformation found while analyzing the environment using the operational and\nmission variables and civil considerations. The \u201cimpact\u201d questions focus the\nanalyzed information to develop the religious impact assessment.

As a starting point, the religious area analysis initially identifies religious groups\nin an OE and provides a short information brief on each religious group with the primary\nfocus on issues that impact the current operational situation and the unit mission. This\ncommunicates the total population and location of religious groups to commanders and\nstaffs.\nA-3. After gathering the initial information in paragraph A-1, chaplains and religious\naffairs specialists can use PMESII-PT format as one method to add depth to the religious\narea analysis and begin an analysis of the impact of the religious factors on unit\noperations to complete the religious impact assessment for commander and staffs.\nA-4.

A chaplain\u2019s ability\nto accept diversity, as opposed to judging diversity, is a critical component to success.\nChaplains and religious affairs specialists must focus on building legitimacy as they\nconsider the impact of military operations on popular perceptions. Chaplains and\nreligious affairs specialists\u2019 success is enhanced when they work \u201cby, with, and through\u201d\ntheir local counterparts. (For more information on advisors, see FM 3-13.)\nKEYS FOR SOLDIER AND LEADER ENGAGEMENT\nB-2. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists execute the advise capability in the\ncomplexities of an OE through an integrated approach. This approach is described in\nparagraphs B-3 through B-5.\nWORK AHEAD\nB-3. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists anticipate, analyze and examine\nreligious factors in an OE that could impact the mission. These religious factors include\nreligious holidays, religious leaders, and religious sites. Chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists build a composite of religious factors in an OE that can enable staffs during\ncontingency planning.\nFOCUS ON ESSENTIALS\nB-4. Religion is complex, but the essentials for understanding the behavior of a group\ninclude some commonalities, for example, significance, security, safety, purpose,\ninitiation rituals, social elements, remembrance rituals, experiences with the sacred, and\nthe need for sacred spaces. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists begin the\nintegration process of advising commanders and staffs by thinking through the religious\nfactors impacting an OE.\nSTAY OBJECTIVE ORIENTED\nB-5. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists contribute to mission planning by\nparticipating in mission analysis. They also stay informed about the mission.\n31 January 2019 ATP 1-05.03 B-1",
            "Appendix B\nINTEGRATE RELIGIOUS FACTORS\nB-6. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists understand the impact of religion on the\nmission and factor religious risks into the course of action development process. There\nare operations where there are no indigenous religious issues or factors. Chaplains and\nreligious affairs specialists remain patient and consistently execute the external advisor\ncapability in the operations process because there will be operations in which religious\nissues are critically important.\nB-7. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists are members of the unit. As such,\nthey\u2014\n\uf06c Advise the command on the effect local religions have on the mission.\n\uf06c Advise the commander on the morale, moral, and spiritual health and welfare\nof Soldiers.\n\uf06c Research and advise the command on the religious attitudes and activities of\nthe civilian population in an AO, religious and cultural dynamics, religious\norganizations, and religious leaders in an AO.\n\uf06c Help Soldiers understand the challenges and opportunities of the religious\nterrain affecting an OE.\n\uf06c Contribute to command understanding.\n\uf06c Go beyond analysis and provide assessment (answer how this factor affects\nthe mission).\n\uf06c Start early in the planning process and stay engaged.\n\uf06c Keep the \u201cSo what?\u201d question constantly in mind.\n\uf06c Make their advice relevant and salient.\n\uf06c Help commanders and staffs see religious factors as a force for stability and\nviolence.\n\uf06c Require objectivity, suspend personal biases, and unpack personal cultural\nbaggage. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists do not let personal bias\nor cultural preference demean the value of another religion. Analysis is an\naccurate assessment of what is, not what one thinks it should be.\n\uf06c Are empathetic and respectful of the religious beliefs and practices of others,\neven if they disagree, or when they are in conflict with their own beliefs.\n\uf06c Are integrated, nested, and synchronized with staffs, working groups, and the\nlines of effort.\n\uf06c Are tangible, mission-focused, applicable, and realistic (instead of being\ntheoretical).\n\uf06c Provide effects and are product-driven.\n\uf06c Consider cultural issues as part of religious assessment.\n\uf06c Ask, \u201cWho else needs to know?\u201d and disseminate information.\n\uf06c Forge a team effort. Both chaplains and religious affairs specialists should be\ninvolved.\n\uf06c Include on-going evaluation and assessment of their own effectiveness.\nB-2 ATP 1-05.03 31 January 2019",
            "Religious Advisor and Soldier and Leader Engagement\nB-8. Supervisory chaplain sections and UMTs direct and advise unit members. They\u2014\n\uf06c Mentor, coach, and train subordinate chaplains and religious affairs\nspecialists to be advisors.\n\uf06c Develop an awareness of religious factors that impact an OE.\n\uf06c Maintain situational understanding and understanding of religion\u2019s impact in\nworld events.\n\uf06c Anticipate the mission and destination of the unit.\n\uf06c Gather facts about local religions expected in an OE.\n\uf06c Integrate into working groups of staff boards and inform commanders of\nreligious factors in an AO. They issue fragmentary orders with relevant\ninformation such as religious holidays and celebrations and their impact on\nthe mission.\nB-9. Supervisory chaplain sections and UMTs follow general principles when\ndirecting RS. To follow these principles, they\u2014\n\uf06c Understand an OE.\n\uf06c Recognize religious implications.\n\uf06c Study and understand local language, culture, and values.\n\uf06c Develop cross cultural communication and engagement skills.\n\uf06c Understand local counterparts\u2019 capabilities and limitations.\n\uf06c Facilitate interagency activities.\n\uf06c Consider long-term effects.\n\uf06c Build legitimacy and confidence.\n\uf06c Build teams.\n\uf06c Develop multiple options.\n\uf06c Use creativity to make the difference between success and failure.\n\uf06c Balance security and synchronization.\nB-10.

            "Appendix C\nSoldier and Leader Engagement and the\nOperations Process\nC-1. An engagement conducted by a chaplain and religious affairs specialist requires\nthe same level of careful planning as any other tactical mission. Like any other mission,\nchaplains and religious affairs specialists use the operations process (planning,\npreparation, execution, and assessment) to ensure effective mission success with\nsufficient planning, quality preparation, disciplined execution, continuous assessment,\nand integrated leader involvement.\nC-2. As chaplains and religious affairs specialists integrate into the operations process\n(of plan, prepare, execute, and assess), they ask initial external advisement focus\nquestions.

MIL-STD 2525Dis the single standard for\ndeveloping and depicting computer-generated military symbols for use in command and control systems. FM\n1-02.2 is the proponent for hand drawn alternate symbols, course of action sketch symbols applicable to U.S.\nArmy doctrine, and approved for use military symbols that are not currently included in MIL-STD 2525D\ndue to difference in revision timeline. Use this publication as the standard for properly constructing land\noperations associated military symbols for communicating instructions to subordinate units, commanders,\nand staffs from company throughcorps echelons.\nThis publication is augmented by FM 1-02.1, Operational Terms, and Army Dictionary online. Changes to\nmilitary symbols occur more frequently than traditional publication media can be updated. The terminology\nand military symbol database, known as the Army Dictionary, is updated monthly to reflect the latest editions\nof Army publications. (To access the database, go to https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/index.jsp?pindex=207, and log\nin with a common access card.) This database is an official DOD website, maintained by the Combined Arms\nDoctrine Directorate in collaboration with the Joint Staff Directorate for Joint Force Development. The site\nis part of the Joint Doctrine, Education, and Training Electronic Information System. It includes all Army\ndoctrinal terms and all military symbols in MIL-STD 2525D, including air, land, maritime, space, activities,\nand control measures.\nFM 1-02.2 is organized as follows:\nChapter 1 introduces military symbol fundamentals.\nChapters 2 through 4 provide icons for units, individuals, organizations, equipment, installations, and\nactivities.\nChapter 5 introduces control measure symbols.\nChapter 6 discusses tactical mission tasks.\nChapter 7 discusses the course of action sketch.\nThese chapters provide detailed requirements for composing and constructing military symbols. The rules\nfor building a set of military symbols allow enough flexibility for users to create any symbol to meet their\noperational needs. All military symbols construct standards are governed by MIL-STD 2525D, and this\npublication serves as the compendium of land related military symbols used in U.S. Army doctrine and\ntraining manuals.\nFM 1-02.2 is now the proponent of military symbols that were included in ADP 1-02 as the preceding\nproponent.\nThe introductory table on page xprovides a listing of new and modified military symbol changes published\nin this manual.\n(cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:3)(cid:48)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 1-02.2 ix",

            "Chapter 1\nMilitary Symbol Fundamentals\nThis chapter discusses the MIL-STD 2525D military symbol construct standards for\nframed and unframed symbol standard identity, physical domain, color usage, and the\nplacement of main icons, modifiers, and amplifiers. Military symbols are logograms\nthat represent words or terms used to depict abstract graphic representations of a unit,\nequipment, installation, activity, control measure, or tactical mission task relevant to\nmilitary operations. These symbols are available for use in course of action sketches,\nvisualizing operation orders, planning, maps, overlays, and command and control\nsystem displays to represent a current common operational picture.\nFRAMED SYMBOLS\n1-1. Framed symbols allow the depiction of units, equipment, installations, and activities by using a\ncombination of main icon, modifiers, amplifiers, and color (optional) to complete the military symbol\nconstruct. The frame is the border of the symbol and serves as the base to which other symbol components\nare added, and indicates the standard identity, physical domain, and status of the object being represented.\nFramed symbol may use standard identity colors to enhance depiction, or can be black and white depending\non display. (See table 1-4on page 1-5.)\nSTANDARD IDENTITY\n1-2. The framed shape design identifies the symbol standard identity. The standard identify frame shape\ncategories are unknown, pending, assumed friend, friend, neutral, suspect, and hostile. Table 1-1 (on page\n1-2) depicts the standard identity frame shapes categorized by physical domains.\nPHYSICAL DOMAIN\n1-3. The physical domain defines the primary mission area above the earth\u2019s surface (in the air domain or\nspace domain), on the earth\u2019s surface (land domain or maritime domain), or below the earth\u2019s surface\n(subsurface domain). Frame shapes differ by surface (land and sea), sea subsurface, air, and space physical\ndomains. Table 1-1 (on page 1-2) lists and depicts the frame shapes usage for each of these physical domains\nby land unit, installation, activity, land and sea surface equipment, air equipment (inflight),space equipment\n(in space), and sea subsurface equipment.\n1-4. Frame shape symbol use is dependent on the object\u2019s current physical domain. An aircraft, regardless\nof Service ownership, can be depicted in either the air domain (in flight) or land domain (on the ground),\nwhile aviation units are depicted as land units and facilities as land installations. The exception is surface\nequipment (land and sea) frames that do not change between land and maritime physical domains. An\nexample is an amphibious vehicle that use the same frame shape regardless of current physical domain\nbecause it can operate in both land and maritime domains.\n(cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:3)(cid:48)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM1-02.2 1-1",

These\n3 areas are composed of the center area that is reserved for the main function area (main icon), the upper area\n(left area if vertical) reserved for sector 1 capability modifier, and lower area (right area if vertical) reserved\nfor sector 2 capability modifier. The octagon may be used horizontally or vertically to allow for effective use\nof the space when placing main and modifier icons.

The main icon for units, equipment, installations, or activities provides the main function of the military\nsymbol construct. It is placed in the innermost part of the symbol construct, and is represented as the center\narea of Field A and Field AA. In general, main icons should not be so large as to exceed the dimensions of\nthe main sector of the placement octagon or touch the interior border when framed. There are exceptions to\nthe framed size rule because some main icons occupy the entire frame, and they must exceed the dimensions\nof the placement octagon and touch the interior border of the frame. These symbols are called full-frame\nmain icons and occur only in land domain symbols. Figure 1-1 shows an example of a full frame main icon\nfor all frame shapes.\n1-4 FM 1-02.2 (cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:3)(cid:48)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)",

A modifier provides additional capability information when portraying a symbol. Modifiers conform\nto the octagon and are placed either above (sector 1) or below (sector 2). The main function icon is represented\nas part of Field A and Field AA. Some modifiers are interchangeable (multiple usage) and may be used as a\nsector 1 and sector 2 modifier with the same meaning. This publication defines various types of modifiers\nand indicates their placement in relation to the main function icon.\nSTANDARD IDENTITY COLORS\n1-9. Standard identity colors are used as the fill areas for framed military symbols, and line colors for\nunframed and framed military symbols. Unframed symbols require color as the standard identity indicator if\ntext amplifiers are not used to categorize the symbol. Fill and line color are optional for framed symbols\nbecause the frame design provides the standard identity, and color is only a redundant identity indicator used\nto enhance the framed symbol. The framed symbol fill is normally white or transparent when color is not\nused in the depiction. Table 1-4 provides the approved standard identity color variants for military symbol\nconstruct fill and line colors.\nTable 1-4.

Each respective chapter provides the applicable amplifier placement template and amplifier field\nlisting for all military symbol constructsthat have the option to use amplifiers.\nSYMBOL LETTERING\n1-11. The lettering for all military symbols will always be uppercase, sans serif font, right aligned on the left\nof side, left aligned on the right, and centered on top. In some cases the lettering may be tilted slightly to\nfollow the contour of a line, but must be oriented for left-to-right legibility and avoid tilting so much that\nreaders must tilt their heads to read it.\nUNFRAMED SYMBOLS\n1-12. Equipment symbols may be depicted with frame or unframed. Control measure symbols and mission\ntask symbols are unframed symbols that conform to special rules for their own elements.\nUNFRAMED EQUIPMENT SYMBOLS\n1-13. The military symbol construct standard permits the depiction of equipment symbols with or without a\nframe. Unframed equipment symbol constructs follow the same icon and amplifier placement rules as framed\nequipment symbols. The only difference is that the main icon of the symbol construct serves as the base for\nadding modifiers and amplifiers, and it must use standard identity colors (blue, red, green, or yellow) to\neffectively depict and distinguish friendly or assumed friend, hostile or suspect, neutral, and unknown or\npending units. Chapter 3 provides the equipment symbol icon and amplifier guidelines.\nTACTICAL MISSION TASK SYMBOLS\n1-14. Tactical mission task symbols are used in course of action sketches, synchronization matrices, and\nmaneuver sketches. Tactical mission task symbols are sized to accommodate the scale of the display or map,\nand they may be used with other framed and unframed symbols, but they do not use modifiers or amplifiers.\nChapter 6 provides tactical mission task symbol listings and construct examples.\nCONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n1-15. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions.Control measure symbols\nhave different unique construct template patterns for each type of control measure, but they use similar\nstandard identity colors and amplifiers as other military symbols. They can be black or white, depending on\ntheir display background. Display backgrounds can be blue (for friendly), red (for hostile), green (for\nobstacles), or yellow (for a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contaminated area fill). See chapter\n5 for description, placement, and further details of control measure symbols.\nMAINICONS FOR CONTROL MEASURES\n1-16. Similar to frame symbols, field A identifies the location for control measures main icon placement.\nThe main icon provides the ability to depict the main or supporting function within the construct composition\nof a control measure. Some control measures symbol constructs permit the use of Field A to embed a\ncompleted framed symbol construct. Not all control measures have this placement field, and the control\nmeasure templates in chapter 5 indicate if the construct composition provides the capability to add a main\nicon to the symbol.\nMODIFIERS FOR CONTROL MEASURES\n1-17.

            "Military Symbol Fundamentals\nMILITARY SYMBOL CONSTRUCT PROCESS\n1-18. Military symbol construct is a logographic writing system similar to words in written language. Each\nsymbol has a specific meaning that when combined with other symbols provides legible information that can\nbe used to quickly identify units, organizations,and capabilities andto understand current or future actions.\nThe military symbol construct process can construct sentences and paragraphs or translate written words into\nmilitary symbols using MIL-STD 2525Dsymbol construct standard used by command and control systems.\nThe symbols in this publication are adequate for depicting a variety of military symbol constructs, but if a\nuser determines there is a gap in the symbol construct language, that user must inform the U.S. Army\nsymbologist so collaboration can begin on creating a required new military symbol.\nCONSTRUCT PROCESS FOR FRAMED SYMBOLS\n1-19.

            "Chapter 5\nControl Measures and Operation Symbols\nThis chapter discusses control measure construct fundamentals for points, lines, and\nareas. It also discusses operation symbols related to offensive and defensive operations.\nFUNDAMENTALS OF CONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n5-1. Amplifiers. An amplifier provides optional additional information about a tactical symbol. The field\nidentification, field title, description, and maximum allowable display lengths of tactical symbol amplifiers\nare in table 5-21 on pages 5-77 through 5-79. An example of each amplifier (including both text and graphic\nindicators) is included in figure 5-2 on page 5-4. Amplifiers can be defined as either static or dynamic:\n(cid:122) Static amplifiers are amplifiers whose size and placement are fixed and remain constant.\n(cid:122) Dynamic amplifiers are amplifiers whose size and placement are based on the attributes of an\nobject, and change as these attributes change.\nCOMPOSITION OF CONTROL MEASURE SYMBOLS\n5-2. Control measure symbols can be combined with other symbols, icons, and amplifiers to display\noperational information. They do not follow the same building rules as the icon-based symbols, but they shall\nbebuilt in accordance with the draw rules specified in the symbol tables. (See figure 5-1.)\nControl Measure Components Completed Control Measure\nSymbol\nAdditional\nIcon-based symbol information\nControl measure\nwith amplifiers amplifier\nFigure 5-1. Composition of control measure symbol\nSTANDARD IDENTITY COLORING CONTROL MEASURES\n5-3. Friendly graphic control measures are shown in black or blue when drawn manually or on a color\ncomputer-generated display. Hostile graphic control measuresare shown in red. If red is not available, they\nare drawn in black with the abbreviation \u201cENY\u201d placed on the graphic in at least two places. Obstacles as\nshown in this chapter (friendly, hostile, neutral, unknown, factional) are drawn using the color green. If the\ncolor green is not available, obstacles should be drawn using black. The color yellow will be used for the\nhatching for CBRN contaminated areas.\nCONTROL MEASURE ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS USAGE\n5-4. The acronyms and abbreviations in this chapter are considered symbols that are part of the military\nsymbol construct for use with Army control measure symbols. No acronyms or abbreviations other than those\n(cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:3)(cid:48)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 1-02.2 5-1",
            "Chapter 5\nprovided in this publication may be used. When acronyms or abbreviations are approved for use with military\nsymbols they become part of the military symbol lexicon.\nOPERATION SYMBOLS\n5-5. Operation symbols are symbols related to offensive and defensive operations, which include movement\nto contact, attack, enabling, and retrograde operations. See types of offense and defense operations in ADP\n3-90 and FM 3-90-1 for more information on operation symbols and their usage. Offensive and defensive\noperations symbols are not control measures, and are used to depict actions conducted during offense and\ndefense operations that enhance operational picture of an operation.\nLABELING CONTROL MEASURES\n5-6. Symbol makers make all text labeling in upper case letters. The reader should be able to read the labels\nfor all text labels of modifier or amplifierfields for control measure symbols when the bottom of the overlay\nis closest to the reader. Labeling written on an angle should be readable to viewers horizontally.\n5-7. Status refers to whether a control measure exists at the location identified (status is \u201cpresent\u201d) or will\nin the future reside at that location (status is \u201cplanned\u201d or \u201csuspected\u201d).

            "Chapter 7\nCourse of Action Sketch\nThis chapter discusses the purpose and makeup of a course of action sketch.\nPURPOSE OF COURSE OF ACTION SKETCH\n7-1. A course of action is a scheme developed to accomplish a mission (JP 5-0). Developing, analyzing,\nand deciding on a course of action for execution is central to planning. Part of course of action development\nis to produce a course of action statement and sketch. The staff prepares a course of action statement and\nsupporting sketch for each course of action under consideration. A Course of action statement clearly\ndescribes the array of forces and the sequence of tasks the unit will conduct to accomplish the mission. The\nstatement should be a brief expression of how the combined arms concept will be conducted. The course of\naction sketch is the graphic portrayal of the course of action statement. The sketch provides a picture of the\nmovement and maneuver aspects of the concept, including positioning of forces. (See FM 6-0 for a detailed\ndiscussion of the military decision-making process, including course of action development.)\nMAKEUP OF COURSE OF ACTION SKETCH\n7-2. The course of action sketch provides a picture of the movement and maneuver aspects of the concept,\nincluding the positioning of forces. The course of action sketch becomes the basis for the operation overlay.\nAt a minimum, the course of action sketch includes the array of generic forces and control measures,\nincluding\u2014\n(cid:122) Unit and subordinate unit boundaries.\n(cid:122) Unit movement formations (but not subordinate unit formations).\n(cid:122) Reconnaissance and security graphics.\n(cid:122) Ground and air axes of advance.\n(cid:122) Assembly areas, battle positions, strong points, engagement areas, and objectives.\n(cid:122) Obstacle control measures and tactical mission graphics.\n(cid:122) Fire support coordination and airspace control measures.\n(cid:122) Main effort.\n(cid:122) Location of command posts and critical communication nodes.\n(cid:122) Enemy locations, known or template.\n(cid:122) Population concentrations.\n7-3. Most symbols for use on the course of action sketch are shown in chapters 2 through 7. However, the\nunit symbols do not provide decision makers with a quick and easy method of portraying detailed information\nrelating to task organization, composition, or combateffectiveness. Task organization composition symbols\nportray detailed information for course of action sketches.\nTASK ORGANIZATION COMPOSITION SYMBOLS\n7-4. Part of course of action development includes determining relative combat power and arraying forces\nto accomplish the primary tasks envisioned during action. After arraying forces, planners then group these\nforces underneath a generic headquarters representing the initial task organization. The initial task\norganization for each generic unit is portrayed in a task organization composition symbol.\n(cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:3)(cid:48)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 1-02.2 7-1",

Duringcourse of action analysis and war gaming, the staff can track the combat effectiveness of units\nusing combat effectiveness icons in task organization composition symbols. Combat effectiveness refers to\nthe ability of a unit to perform its mission. Factorssuch as ammunition, personnel, status of fuel, and weapons\nsystems availability are assessed and rated. Commanders use this information to provide a net assessment of\na unit\u2019s ability to perform its mission. This assessment can then be expressed graphically using combat\neffectiveness icons. Table 7-2 on page 7-5 shows two sets of combat effectiveness icons, which may be also\nused with task organization composition symbols.\n7-8. Table 7-2 (page 7-5) depicts combat effectiveness icons for the overall combat rating of a unit in the\ncenter column.
